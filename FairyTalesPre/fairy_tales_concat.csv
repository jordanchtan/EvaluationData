she plucks the withered leaf from the balsam and looks at the grass covered rampart on which many children are playing .,sadness
what is the old maid thinking of ?,sadness
the poor little children how happy they are how merrily they play and romp together !,joy
what red cheeks and what angels ' eyes ! but they have no shoes nor stockings .,sadness
the little people who now play on that spot know nothing of the old tale else would they fancy they heard a child crying deep below the earth and the dewdrops on each blade of grass would be to them tears of woe .,joy
nor do they know anything of the danish king who here in the face of the coming foe took an oath before all his trembling courtiers that he would hold out with the citizens of his capital and die here in his nest; they know nothing of the men who have fought here or of the women who from here have drenched with boiling water the enemy clad in white and ' biding in the snow to surprise the city .,sadness
no ! the poor little ones are playing with light childish spirits .,sadness
play on play on thou little maiden !,sadness
the priestly hands have been laid on the candidates for confirmation; hand in hand they walk on the green rampart .,sadness
thou hast a white frock on; it has cost thy mother much labor and yet it is only cut down for thee out of an old larger dress !,sadness
you will also wear a red shawl; and what if it hang too far down ?,anger
people will only see how large how very large it is .,sadness
you are thinking of your dress and of the giver of all good so glorious is it to wander on the green rampart !,joy
and the years roll by; they have no lack of dark days but you have your cheerful young spirit and you have gained a friend you know not how .,joy
you met oh how often !,surprise
you walk together on the rampart in the fresh spring on the high days and holidays when all the world come out to walk upon the ramparts and all the bells of the church steeples seem to be singing a song of praise for the coming spring .,joy
alas !,sadness
it is not so with the human heart !,sadness
dark mists more in number than those that cover the northern skies cloud the human heart .,sadness
poor child ! thy friend ' s bridal chamber is a black coffin and thou becomest an old maid .,sadness
from the almshouse window behind the balsams thou shalt look on the merry children at play and shalt see thine own history renewed .,sadness
and that is the life drama that passes before the old maid while she looks out upon the rampart the green sunny rampart where the children with their red cheeks and bare shoeless feet are rejoicing merrily like the other free little birds .,sadness
whenever a good child dies an angel of god comes down from heaven takes the dead child in his arms spreads out his great white wings and flies with him over all the places which the child had loved during his life .,sadness
then he gathers a large handful of flowers which he carries up to the almighty that they may bloom more brightly in heaven than they do on earth .,joy
and the almighty presses the flowers to his heart but he kisses the flower that pleases him best and it receives a voice and is able to join the song of the chorus of bliss .,joy
then they passed over well known spots where the little one had often played and through beautiful gardens full of lovely flowers .,joy
"which of these shall we take with us to heaven to be transplanted there ? "" asked the angel .",joy
close by grew a slender beautiful rose bush but some wicked hand had broken the stem and the half opened rosebuds hung faded and withered on the trailing branches .,sadness
"poor rose bush ! "" said the child "" let us take it with us to heaven that it may bloom above in god ' s garden .",sadness
the angel took up the rose bush; then he kissed the child and the little one half opened his eyes .,joy
the angel gathered also some beautiful flowers as well as a few humble buttercups and heart ' s ease .,joy
"now we have flowers enough "" said the child; but the angel only nodded he did not fly upward to heaven .",joy
there lay fragments of plates pieces of plaster rags old hats and other rubbish not pleasant to see .,anger
amidst all this confusion the angel pointed to the pieces of a broken flower pot and to a lump of earth which had fallen out of it .,sadness
the earth had been kept from falling to pieces by the roots of a withered field flower which had been thrown amongst the rubbish .,sadness
"we will take this with us "" said the angel "" i will tell you why as we fly along .",joy
down in that narrow lane in a low cellar lived a poor sick boy; he had been afflicted from his childhood and even in his best days he could just manage to walk up and down the room on crutches once or twice but no more .,sadness
in this spot the poor sick boy would sit warming himself in the sunshine and watching the red blood through his delicate fingers as he held them before his face .,sadness
then he would say he had been out yet he knew nothing of the green forest in its spring verdure till a neighbor ' s son brought him a green bough from a beech tree .,surprise
this he would place over his head and fancy that he was in the beech wood while the sun shone and the birds carolled gayly .,joy
one spring day the neighbor ' s boy brought him some field flowers and among them was one to which the root still adhered .,surprise
this he carefully planted in a flower pot and placed in a window seat near his bed .,joy
and the flower had been planted by a fortunate hand for it grew put forth fresh shoots and blossomed every year .,joy
it became a splendid flower garden to the sick boy and his little treasure upon earth .,joy
he watered it and cherished it and took care it should have the benefit of every sunbeam that found its way into the cellar from the earliest morning ray to the evening sunset .,joy
the flower entwined itself even in his dreams for him it bloomed for him spread its perfume .,joy
and it gladdened his eyes and to the flower he turned even in death when the lord called him .,joy
he has been one year with god .,sadness
during that time the flower has stood in the window withered and forgotten till at length cast out among the sweepings into the street on the day of the lodgers ' removal .,sadness
and this poor flower withered and faded as it is we have added to our nosegay because it gave more real joy than the most beautiful flower in the garden of a queen .,joy
"but how do you know all this ? "" asked the child whom the angel was carrying to heaven .",surprise
"i know it "" said the angel "" because i myself was the poor sick boy who walked upon crutches and i know my own flower well .",joy
then the child opened his eyes and looked into the glorious happy face of the angel and at the same moment they found themselves in that heavenly home where all is happiness and joy .,joy
and god pressed the dead child to his heart and wings were given him so that he could fly with the angel hand in hand .,joy
then the almighty pressed all the flowers to his heart; but he kissed the withered field flower and it received a voice .,joy
then it joined in the song of the angels who surrounded the throne some near and others in a distant circle but all equally happy .,joy
they all joined in the chorus of praise both great and small the good happy child and the poor field flower that once lay withered and cast away on a heap of rubbish in a narrow dark street .,joy
then he would cry but what nobody knows nobody cares for; so he would cry till he was tired and then fall asleep; and while we are asleep we can feel neither hunger nor thirst .,sadness
if he went near the farmyard belonging to the count he was pushed and knocked about for the men and the maids said he was so horrible ugly; but he was used to all this for nobody loved him .,sadness
her beautiful noble child had been a dear angel and possessed the kindest heart; he had loved her so much and she had loved him in return; they had kissed and loved each other and the boy had been her joy her second life .,joy
certainly he must long to see me too the young count; no doubt he thinks of me and loves me as in those days when he would fling his angel arms round my neck and lisp ' anne liz . ',joy
it was music to my ears .,joy
it was as great and magnificent as it had always been and the garden looked the same as ever; all the servants were strangers to her not one of them knew anne lisbeth nor of what consequence she had once been there; but she felt sure the countess would soon let them know it and her darling boy too : how she longed to see him !,joy
"well well "" he said; and with that he walked out of the room .",anger
anne lisbeth went forth from the castle into the public road feeling mournful and sad; he whom she had nursed day and night and even now carried about in her dreams had been cold and strange and had not a word or thought respecting her .,sadness
"ah "" said she "" what bird of ill omen art thou ?",sadness
she felt very low spirited because her count child had shown no inclination to speak to her who loved him so well and who had travelled so far to see him .,sadness
the journey had cost money too and she had derived no great pleasure from it .,sadness
"the black wretch ! "" said anne lisbeth "" he will end by frightening me today .",anger
"stop ! stop ! "" and the words came quite clear though they were like the croak of a frog or the wail of a bird .",anger
a grave ! dig me a grave !,anger
"he nodded and pointed to anne lisbeth crying out "" hold fast ! hold fast ! and then you may ride again in a nobleman ' s carriage and forget your child .",anger
in the face of anne lisbeth lighted up by the evening sun could be seen peace and rest .,joy
she said she was happy now for she had conquered .,joy
"now i am in the house of god "" she said "" and in that house we are happy .",joy
when the sun set anne lisbeth ' s soul had risen to that region where there is no more pain; and anne lisbeth ' s troubles were at an end .,joy
the branch well knew how beautiful it was; this knowledge exists as much in the leaf as in the blood; i was therefore not surprised when a nobleman ' s carriage in which sat the young countess stopped in the road just by .,joy
she said that an apple branch was a most lovely object and an emblem of spring in its most charming aspect .,joy
"poor despised herbs "" said the apple branch; "" there is really a difference between them and such as i am .",anger
and the apple branch looked with a sort of pity upon them especially on a certain little flower that is found in fields and in ditches .,sadness
"a difference ! "" cried the sunbeam as he kissed the blooming apple branch and then kissed the yellow dandelion out in the fields .",surprise
"you do not see very far nor very clearly "" he said to the apple branch .",anger
which is the despised plant you so specially pity ?,anger
no one ever places it in a nosegay; it is often trodden under foot there are so many of them; and when they run to seed they have flowers like wool which fly away in little pieces over the roads and cling to the dresses of the people .,anger
they are only weeds; but of course there must be weeds .,anger
o i am really very thankful that i was not made like one of these flowers .,joy
there came presently across the fields a whole group of children the youngest of whom was so small that it had to be carried by the others; and when he was seated on the grass among the yellow flowers he laughed aloud with joy kicked out his little legs rolled about plucked the yellow flowers and kissed them in childlike innocence .,joy
"do you see "" said the sunbeam "" do you see the beauty of these flowers ? do you see their powers of giving pleasure ?",joy
"see "" she exclaimed "" how wonderfully god has made this little flower .",joy
i will paint it with the apple branch together .,joy
but inside the church the pastor stood in the pulpit and spoke very loudly and angrily .,anger
he said that all men were wicked and god would punish them for their sins and that the wicked when they died would be cast into hell to burn for ever and ever .,anger
he spoke very excitedly saying that their evil propensities would not be destroyed nor would the fire be extinguished and they should never find rest .,anger
"meanwhile the birds sang merrily outside and the sun was shining so beautifully warm it seemed as though every little flower said : "" god thy kindness towards us all is without limits .",joy
the same evening upon going to bed the pastor noticed his wife sitting there quiet and pensive .,sadness
i am only a woman and a sinner before god but i should not have the heart to let even the worst sinner burn for ever and how could our lord to do so who is so infinitely good and who knows how the wickedness comes from without and within ?,sadness
no i am unable to imagine that although you say so .,surprise
she was buried; two large tears rolled over the cheeks of the earnest man and in the parsonage it was empty and still for its sun had set for ever .,sadness
she fixed her eyes upon him with such a kind and sad expression just as if she wished to say something to him .,sadness
"the pastor raised himself in bed and stretched his arms towards her saying "" not even you can find eternal rest !",surprise
you suffer you best and most pious woman ?,surprise
and can i not obtain rest in the grave for you ?,surprise
"yes therein as i believed as i knew it "" said the pastor "" are living those who are abandoned to the eternal fire .",surprise
"what he thought was sufficiently expressed in his features and movements : "" miserable beggars who are looking in you are nothing in comparison to me .",anger
he is but a poor fool and not doomed to be tortured eternally by fire !,surprise
only a fool !,surprise
he is ill !,surprise
that is madness a joyless madness besieged by fear and dreadful dreams !,surprise
"like a ferocious animal one of them rose out of his sleep and uttered a horrible cry and gave his comrade a violent dig in the ribs with his pointed elbow and this one turned round in his sleep : "" be quiet monster sleep !",anger
this happens every night !,anger
"every night ! "" repeated the other .",anger
yes every night he comes and tortures me !,anger
i myself helped to rescue cattle and things nothing alive burnt except a flight of pigeons which flew into the fire and the yard dog of which i had not thought; one could hear him howl out of the fire and this howling i still hear when i wish to sleep; and when i have fallen asleep the great rough dog comes and places himself upon me and howls presses and tortures me .,sadness
you can snore; you are snoring the whole night and i hardly a quarter of an hour !,anger
and the blood rose to the head of the excited criminal; he threw himself upon his comrade and beat him with his clenced fist in the face .,anger
"wicked matz has become mad again ! "" they said amongst themselves .",anger
"you are killing the unfortunate man "" said the pastor and as he stretched out his hand to protect him who already suffered too much the scene changed .",sadness
"i have it now ! "" said the dead woman .",joy
he talked and told anecdotes and every one listened to him with pleasure not unmingled with awe; but none felt so much respect for him as did the elderly widow of a naval officer .,joy
"i should like to see rome "" she said; "" it must be a lovely city or so many foreigners would not be constantly arriving there .",joy
"an organist ! "" exclaimed the lady who had never heard the word ' obelisk . '",surprise
several of the guests could scarcely forbear laughing and the sculptor would have had some difficulty in keeping his countenance but the smile on his lips faded away; for he caught sight of a pair of dark blue eyes close by the side of the inquisitive lady .,joy
she was a study for the sculptor to contemplate but not to converse with; for she did not speak or at least very seldom .,joy
"i don ' t like that "" was the lady ' s remark .",anger
mr . alfred again spoke of italy and of the glorious colors in italian scenery; the purple hills the deep blue of the mediterranean the azure of southern skies whose brightness and glory could only be surpassed in the north by the deep blue eyes of a maiden; and he said this with a peculiar intonation; but she who should have understood his meaning looked quite unconscious of it which also was charming .,joy
"beautiful italy ! "" sighed some of the guests .",joy
"oh to travel there ! "" exclaimed others .",joy
"charming ! "" echoed from every voice .",joy
"i may perhaps win a hundred thousand dollars in the lottery "" said the naval officer ' s widow; "" and if i do we will travel i and my daughter; and you mr . alfred must be our guide .",joy
we can all three travel together with one or two more of our good friends .,joy
and she nodded in such a friendly way at the company that each imagined himself to be the favored person who was to accompany them to italy .,joy
those deep blue eyes which had been lit up this evening in honor of him must conceal treasures treasures of heart and mind richer than all the glories of rome; and so when he left the party that night he had lost it completely to the young lady .,joy
"the young man felt the truth of the proverb "" still waters run deep : "" and his heart had sunk into their depths .",joy
it was a pleasure to hear alfred describe anything .,joy
"good heavens ! "" she exclaimed .",surprise
oh the poor people !,surprise
and you saw all that with your own eyes ?,surprise
"he placed a pencil sketch on the table; and mamma who had been over powered with the appearance of the colored plates threw a glance at the pale drawing and cried in astonishment "" what did you see it throw up white fire ?",surprise
for a moment alfred ' s respect for kaela ' s mamma underwent a sudden shock and lessened considerably; but dazzled by the light which surrounded kaela he soon found it quite natural that the old lady should have no eye for color .,anger
the betrothed pair were very happy and the mother was happy too .,joy
"you are a true successor of thorwalsden "" she said to alfred; and it seemed to him as if in this instance mamma had said a clever thing .",joy
kaela was silent; but her eyes shone her lips smiled every movement was graceful in fact she was beautiful; that cannot be repeated too often .,joy
"ah yes you are always so polite "" said mamma with a smile; and kaela silently pressed his hand all soiled as it was with the clay .",joy
kaela ' s beauty had a firm hold on alfred; it filled his soul and held a mastery over him .,joy
songs were sung and cheers given; for it was a gay wedding and they were a handsome pair .,joy
they felt the want of a change of air and consequently the young couple and their mother travelled to italy .,anger
"thank heaven we are at home again within our own four walls "" said mamma in law and daughter both on their return after a year ' s absence .",joy
"there is no real pleasure in travelling "" said mamma; "" to tell the truth it ' s very wearisome; i beg pardon for saying so .",anger
i was soon very tired of it although i had my children with me; and besides it ' s very expensive work travelling very expensive .,anger
and all those galleries one is expected to see and the quantity of things you are obliged to run after !,anger
it must be done for very shame; you are sure to be asked when you come back if you have seen everything and will most likely be told that you ' ve omitted to see what was best worth seeing of all .,anger
i got tired at last of those endless madonnas; i began to think i was turning into a madonna myself .,anger
"and then the living mamma "" said kaela .",anger
"yes indeed "" she replied "" no such a thing as a respectable meat soup their cookery is miserable stuff .",anger
mamma in law acknowledged that sophy was not only a clever housewife but well informed and accomplished though that could hardly be expected in a person of her limited means .,joy
"she was beautiful "" said her mother; "" she was quite different from the beauties they call ' antiques ' for they are so damaged .",sadness
alfred wept and mamma wept and they both wore mourning .,sadness
the black dress suited mamma very well and she wore mourning the longest .,sadness
she had also to experience another grief in seeing alfred marry again marry sophy who was nothing at all to look at .,sadness
"he ' s gone to the very extreme "" said mamma in law; "" he has gone from the most beautiful to the ugliest and he has forgotten his first wife .",anger
men have no constancy .,anger
"' pygmalion loved his galatea ' was in the song they sung at my first wedding "" said alfred; "" i once fell in love with a beautiful statue which awoke to life in my arms; but the kindred soul which is a gift from heaven the angel who can feel and sympathize with and elevate us i have not found and won till now .",joy
"that was not a loving speech "" said sophy "" nor spoken like a christian .",anger
"why you must be out of your senses "" cried the farrier .",surprise
golden shoes for you indeed !,surprise
"but why does the horse have golden shoes ? "" asked the farrier; "" of course you understand the reason ?",surprise
understand !,surprise
"well i understand that it is a personal slight to me "" cried the beetle .",anger
it is done to annoy me so i intend to go out into the world and seek my fortune .,anger
"you ' re a rude fellow "" cried the beetle as he walked out of the stable; and then he flew for a short distance till he found himself in a beautiful flower garden all fragrant with roses and lavender .",anger
"the lady birds with red and black shells on their backs and delicate wings were flying about and one of them said "" is it not sweet and lovely here ?",joy
oh how beautiful everything is .,joy
"i am accustomed to better things "" said the beetle .",anger
do you call this beautiful ?,anger
why there is not even a dung heap .,anger
"how beautiful this world is ! "" said the caterpillar .",joy
the sun is so warm i quite enjoy it .,joy
and soon i shall go to sleep and die as they call it but i shall wake up with beautiful wings to fly with like a butterfly .,joy
"how conceited you are ! "" exclaimed the beetle .",anger
fly about as a butterfly indeed ! what of that .,anger
i have come out of the emperor ' s stable and no one there not even the emperor ' s horse who in fact wears my cast off golden shoes has any idea of flying excepting myself .,anger
"to have wings and fly ! why i can do that already; "" and so saying he spread his wings and flew away .",anger
"i don ' t want to be disgusted "" he said to himself "" and yet i can ' t help it .",anger
towards morning he crept out of his hiding place feeling in a very bad temper with the climate .,anger
two frogs were sitting on the linen and their bright eyes actually glistened with pleasure .,joy
"wonderful weather this "" cried one of them "" and so refreshing .",joy
this linen holds the water together so beautifully that my hind legs quiver as if i were going to swim .,joy
what delicious moisture !,joy
it is as pleasant as lying in a wet ditch .,joy
is there not even a dunghill here in this garden where a person of rank like myself could take up his abode and feel at home ?,anger
"our dear son has engaged himself "" said one mother "" dear innocent boy; his greatest ambition is that he may one day creep into a clergyman ' s ear .",joy
that is a very artless and loveable wish; and being engaged will keep him steady .,joy
what happiness for a mother !,joy
"how charming this is for a mother is it not mr . beetle ? "" for she knew the stranger by his horny coat .",joy
"now you shall also see my little earwigs "" said a third and a fourth mother "" they are lovely little things and highly amusing .",joy
"they are always busy about something the little rogues "" said the mother beaming with maternal pride; but the beetle felt it a bore and he therefore inquired the way to the nearest dung heap .",anger
"when he arrived at the ditch he met several friends all them beetles; "" we live here "" they said "" and we are very comfortable .",joy
"certainly "" said the beetle "" i shall be most happy; i have been exposed to the rain and have had to lie upon linen and cleanliness is a thing that greatly exhausts me; i have also pains in one of my wings from standing in the draught under a piece of broken crockery .",joy
it is really quite refreshing to be with one ' s own kindred again .,joy
"none of them are engaged yet "" said their mother and the beetle maidens tittered again this time quite in confusion .",surprise
"i have never seen greater beauties even in the royal stables "" exclaimed the beetle who was now resting himself .",surprise
"the mother gave them her blessing and all the other beetles cried "" hurrah .",joy
"oh "" said the other beetles "" this fellow that we have received into our family is nothing but a complete vagabond .",anger
he has gone away and left his wife a burden upon our hands .,anger
fie on the villain that forsook her !,anger
our beetle considered this speech a great insult so he flew suddenly out of the speaker ' s hand .,anger
all this was very delightful and when the beetle woke up he crept forth and looked around him .,joy
what a splendid place the hothouse was !,joy
"what a wonderful quantity of plants "" cried the beetle; "" how good they will taste when they are decayed !",joy
"what beautiful weather "" said the fly; "" i shall rest here and sun myself .",joy
"you speak without knowing the facts "" replied the beetle; "" don ' t you see that i am a prisoner ?",anger
"well now i know the world "" said the beetle to himself; "" it ' s an abominable world; i ' m the only respectable person in it .",anger
first they refuse me my golden shoes; then i have to lie on damp linen and to stand in a draught; and to crown all they fasten a wife upon me .,anger
this vexes me more than anything .,anger
but it is useless to look for sympathy in this world .,anger
my career has been very interesting but what ' s the use of that if nobody knows anything about it ?,sadness
the world does not deserve to be made acquainted with my adventures for it ought to have given me golden shoes when the emperor ' s horse was shod and i stretched out my feet to be shod too .,anger
if i had received golden shoes i should have been an ornament to the stable; now i am lost to the stable and to the world .,sadness
it is all over with me .,sadness
"and there ' s a poor little creature bound fast in it "" said another .",surprise
"there "" she said "" creep away or fly if thou canst .",joy
it is a splendid thing to have thy liberty .,joy
"well "" he said "" here i am seated on the emperor ' s favorite horse sitting upon him as if i were the emperor himself .",joy
they were given to the horse on my account .,joy
and this reflection put the beetle into a good temper .,joy
the world is not so bad after all if you know how to take things as they come .,joy
the sun was shining the birds were singing and the confirmed children sang too holding each other by the hand for they had no position yet and they were all equal in the eyes of god .,joy
"when the others arrived at the willow trees where the confectioner had put up his stall they said : "" now we are out here; the bell does not in reality exist it is only something that people imagine !",surprise
we must try to find out if it is !,joy
therefore they let him go alone; and as he walked on the solitude of the wood produced a feeling of reverence in his breast; but still he heard the little bell about which the others rejoiced and sometimes when the wind blew in that direction he could hear the sounds from the confectioner ' s stall where the others were singing at tea .,joy
but the poor boy with the wooden shoes was quite ashamed; he pulled at the short sleeves of his jacket and said that he was afraid he could not walk so fast; besides he was of opinion that the bell ought to be sought at the right for there was all that was grand and magnificent .,sadness
"i will and must find the bell "" he said "" if i have to go to the end of the world .",joy
"then the sun set the clouds were as red as fire; it became quiet in the wood; he sank down on his knees sang an evening hymn and said : "" i shall never find what i am looking for !",anger
oh what a splendour !,joy
the sea the great majestic sea which was rolling its long waves against the shore stretched out before him and the sun was standing like a large bright altar and there where sea and heaven met all melted together in the most glowing colours; the wood was singing and his heart too .,joy
the whole of nature was one large holy church in which the trees and hovering clouds formed the pillars the flowers and grass the woven velvet carpet and heaven itself was the great cupola; up there the flame colour vanished as soon as the sun disappeared but millions of stars were lighted; diamond lamps were shining and the king ' s son stretched his arms out towards heaven towards the sea and towards the wood .,joy
and they ran towards each other and took one another ' s hand in the great cathedral of nature and poesy and above them sounded the invisible holy bell; happy spirits surrounded them singing hallelujahs and rejoicing .,joy
grandmother says that she has heard her own grandmother tell of him; he is said to lead a solitary life and to have nobody with whom he can converse save the great old church bell .,sadness
"ding dong ! ding dong ! "" sounded the bell when the tower still stood there; and one evening while the sun was setting and the bell was swinging away bravely it broke loose and came flying down through the air the brilliant metal shining in the ruddy beam .",joy
ding dong ! ding dong !,joy
"now i ' ll retire to rest ! "" sang the bell and flew down into the odense au where it is deepest; and that is why the place is called the "" bell deep .",joy
but the bell got neither rest nor sleep .,sadness
down in the au mann ' s haunt it sounds and rings so that the tones sometimes pierce upward through the waters; and many people maintain that its strains forebode the death of some one; but that is not true for the bell is only talking with the au mann who is now no longer alone .,joy
he had known the nun right well and he thought of her and his heart beat quicker as he thought .,joy
ding dong ! ding dong !,joy
i may sing of everything that is kept concealed behind lock and bars .,sadness
yonder it is cold and wet .,sadness
nobody knows of it !,sadness
nobody hears of it !,sadness
not even now for the bell is ringing and singing its loud ding dong ding dong ! ',sadness
the throng in front of the church knew where they could hit the king and one of them flung a stone through a pane of glass and the king lay there dead !,sadness
the cries and screams of the savage horde and of the birds sounded through the air and i joined in it also; for i sang ' ding dong ! ding dong ! ',sadness
the church bell hangs high and looks far around and sees the birds around it and understands their language .,joy
the wind roars in upon it through windows and loopholes; and the wind knows everything for he gets it from the air which encircles all things and the church bell understands his tongue and rings it out into the world ' ding dong ! ding dong ! ',joy
but it was too much for me to hear and to know; i was not able any longer to ring it out .,sadness
i became so tired so heavy that the beam broke and i flew out into the gleaming au where the water is deepest and where the au mann lives solitary and alone; and year by year i tell him what i have heard and what i know .,sadness
but the schoolmaster says that there was not any bell that rung down there for that it could not do so; and that no au mann dwelt yonder for there was no au mann at all !,sadness
it is around us it is in us it talks of our thoughts and of our deeds and it speaks longer of them than does the bell down in the depths of the odense au where the au mann dwells .,joy
"what has a woman to do with rule ? "" said the bishop .",anger
cursed be she and all that belongs to her .,anger
let her be expelled from the congregation and the church .,anger
let no man stretch forth a helping hand to her and let friends and relations avoid her as a plague and a pestilence !,anger
"thou child of perdition i will yet carry out my purpose ! "" cried the bishop of borglum .",anger
now will i lay the hand of the pope upon thee to summon thee before the tribunal that shall condemn thee !,anger
then one of them mentioned thyland in denmark and spoke of her sorrows of her woes which were soon to cease for so divine providence had willed it .,sadness
he seized her hand he embraced her and the mother wept .,joy
"that will avail him little "" said the bishop .",anger
"thou borglum bishop "" he exclaims "" i shall subdue thee after all !",anger
under the shield of the pope the law cannot reach thee; but jens glob shall reach thee !,anger
"sayest thou so ? "" replied olaf hase .",surprise
hold brother !,surprise
they will have no word more to say in the matter nor will i speak again of all the wrong that my mother has endured .,joy
then their anxieties are dispelled; and at even they join in the dance at the feast given in the great hall at borglum .,joy
an old maid stood at the window; she had hung chickweed over the cage and the little linnet which it contained hopped from perch to perch and sang and twittered merrily .,joy
"yes it ' s all very well for you to sing "" said the bottle neck : that is he did not really speak the words as we do for the neck of a bottle cannot speak; but he thought them to himself in his own mind just as people sometimes talk quietly to themselves .",joy
yes you may sing very well you have all your limbs uninjured; you should feel what it is like to lose your body and only have a neck and a mouth left with a cork stuck in it as i have : you wouldn ' t sing then i know .,anger
i have no reason to sing nor could i sing now if i were ever so happy; but when i was a whole bottle and they rubbed me with a cork didn ' t i sing then ?,sadness
the little bird sang his own song merrily; in the street below there was driving and running to and fro every one thought of his own affairs or perhaps of nothing at all; but the bottle neck thought deeply .,joy
the bottle did not behold the light of day again until it was unpacked with the rest in the wine merchant ' s cellar and for the first time rinsed with water which caused some very curious sensations .,surprise
ah how beautiful is life .,joy
all these tones of joy and song in the bottle were like the working of a young poet ' s brain who often knows not the meaning of the tones which are sounding within him .,joy
she was young and pretty; her brown eyes laughed and a smile lingered round her mouth as sweet as that in her eyes .,joy
there had been a great deal of talk on this subject while the basket was being packed and during this conversation the eyes and the mouth of the furrier ' s daughter did not wear a very joyful expression .,sadness
it remained there a long time; but when at last it was brought forth it appeared as if something pleasant had happened for every one was laughing; the furrier ' s daughter laughed too but she said very little and her cheeks were like two roses .,joy
what a strange sensation it was to have the cork drawn for the first time !,surprise
"long life to the betrothed "" cried the papa and every glass was emptied to the dregs while the young sailor kissed his beautiful bride .",joy
"happiness and blessing to you both "" said the old people father and mother and the young man filled the glasses again .",joy
"safe return and a wedding this day next year "" he cried; and when the glasses were empty he took the bottle raised it on high and said "" thou hast been present here on the happiest day of my life; thou shalt never be used by others !",joy
"i gave them wine and they gave me muddy water "" he had said to himself "" but i suppose it was all well meant .",anger
he could no longer see the betrothed couple nor the cheerful old people; but for a long time he could hear them rejoicing and singing .,joy
"those were happy days and the bottle would sing when rubbed with a cork and it was called a great lark "" "" peter jensen ' s lark .",joy
"at the last moment when the ship was sinking the young mate wrote on a piece of paper "" we are going down : god ' s will be done .",sadness
"what trouble they have taken with that bottle over yonder ! "" said one and very likely it is broken after all .",surprise
but the bottle was not broken and better still it understood every word that was said : this language it had heard at the furnaces and at the wine merchant ' s; in the forest and on the ship it was the only good old language it could understand .,surprise
it had returned home and the language was as a welcome greeting .,joy
for very joy it felt ready to jump out of people ' s hands and scarcely noticed that its cork had been drawn and its contents emptied out till it found itself carried to a cellar to be left there and forgotten .,joy
there ' s no place like home even if it ' s a cellar .,joy
it never occurred to him to think that he might lie there for years he felt so comfortable .,joy
the stars twinkled; and the new moon in the form of a crescent was surrounded by the shadowy disc of the whole moon and looked like a gray globe with a golden rim : it was a beautiful sight for those who had good eyes .,joy
everything here appeared lovely to our bottle for it was again in the green wood amid joy and feasting; again it heard music and song and the noise and murmur of a crowd especially in that part of the garden where the lamps blazed and the paper lanterns displayed their brilliant colors .,joy
it stood in a distant walk certainly but a place pleasant for contemplation; and it carried a light; and was at once useful and ornamental .,joy
it seemed to the bottle as if he were living that time over again .,joy
not only the guests but other people were walking in the garden who were allowed to witness the splendor and the festivities .,joy
she was thinking like the bottle of the green wood and of a young betrothed pair who were closely connected with herself; she was thinking of that hour the happiest of her life in which she had taken part when she had herself been one of that betrothed pair; such hours are never to be forgotten let a maiden be as old as she may .,joy
the rabbit was quite excited because he knew that he was to be taken up and let down again in a parachute .,joy
"then the ropes which held it were cut through and the aerial ship rose in the air with the aeronaut and the basket containing the bottle and the rabbit while the music sounded and all the people shouted "" hurrah .",joy
"this is a wonderful journey up into the air "" thought the bottle; "" it is a new way of sailing and here at least there is no fear of striking against anything .",joy
then it began to descend much more rapidly than the rabbit had done made somersaults in the air and felt itself quite young and unfettered although it was half full of wine .,surprise
then they hung it in the cage of the little bird who sang and twittered more merrily than ever .,joy
do you see how splendidly the tree has grown ?,joy
it has been raised from only a little sprig of myrtle that you gave me on the day after my betrothal and from which i was to make my own bridal bouquet when a year had passed : but that day never came; the eyes were closed which were to have been my light and joy through life .,sadness
before the sprig you gave me faded i took a spray and planted it in the earth; and now as you see it has become a large tree and a bunch of the blossoms shall at last appear at a wedding festival in the bouquet of your daughter .,joy
there were tears in the eyes of the old maid as she spoke of the beloved of her youth and of their betrothal in the wood .,joy
corn grows in the surrounding fields not only rye and barley but oats pretty oats that when ripe look like a number of little golden canary birds sitting on a bough .,joy
the corn has a smiling look and the heaviest and richest ears bend their heads low as if in pious humility .,joy
the buckwheat did not bend like the other grain but erected its head proudly and stiffly on the stem .,joy
"i am as valuable as any other corn "" said he "" and i am much handsomer; my flowers are as beautiful as the bloom of the apple blossom and it is a pleasure to look at us .",joy
do you know of anything prettier than we are you old willow tree ?,joy
"and the willow tree nodded his head as if he would say "" indeed i do .",surprise
"but the buckwheat spread itself out with pride and said "" stupid tree; he is so old that grass grows out of his body .",anger
"i have no occasion to do so "" replied the buckwheat .",anger
"but i will not bend my head "" said the buckwheat .",anger
"inferior indeed ! "" said the buckwheat .",anger
now i intend to have a peep into heaven .,anger
proudly and boldly he looked up while the lightning flashed across the sky as if the whole world were in flames .,joy
when the dreadful storm had passed the flowers and the corn raised their drooping heads in the pure still air refreshed by the rain but the buckwheat lay like a weed in the field burnt to blackness by the lightning .,sadness
the branches of the old willow tree rustled in the wind and large water drops fell from his green leaves as if the old willow were weeping .,sadness
then the sparrows asked why he was weeping when all around him seemed so cheerful .,surprise
"see "" they said how the sun shines and the clouds float in the blue sky .",joy
do you not smell the sweet perfume from flower and bush ?,surprise
wherefore do you weep old willow tree ?,surprise
then the willow told them of the haughty pride of the buckwheat and of the punishment which followed in consequence .,sadness
there was once a butterfly who wished for a bride and as may be supposed he wanted to choose a very pretty one from among the flowers .,joy
he glanced with a very critical eye at all the flower beds and found that the flowers were seated quietly and demurely on their stalks just as maidens should sit before they are engaged; but there was a great number of them and it appeared as if his search would become very wearisome .,anger
the butterfly came also to marguerite to inquire but he did not pluck off her leaves; he pressed a kiss on each of them for he thought there was always more to be done by kindness .,joy
but marguerite did not answer him; she was offended that he should call her a woman when she was only a girl; and there is a great difference .,anger
then he would wait no longer but flew away to commence his wooing at once .,anger
"they are very pretty "" thought the butterfly; "" charming little lasses; but they are rather formal .",joy
he next flew to the anemones; these were rather sour to his taste .,anger
the violet a little too sentimental .,sadness
the pea blossom pleased him most of all; she was white and red graceful and slender and belonged to those domestic maidens who have a pretty appearance and can yet be useful in the kitchen .,joy
he was just about to make her an offer when close by the maiden he saw a pod with a withered flower hanging at the end .,surprise
"oh indeed; and you will be like her some day "" said he; and he flew away directly for he felt quite shocked .",surprise
no; he did not like her .,anger
you know this plant has no blossom; but it is sweetness all over full of fragrance from head to foot with the scent of a flower in every leaf .,joy
"i will take her "" said the butterfly; and he made her an offer .",joy
i am old and you are old but we may live for each other just the same; as to marrying no; don ' t let us appear ridiculous at our age .,anger
he could exist here he said well enough .,joy
"but it is not enough merely to exist "" said he "" i need freedom sunshine and a little flower for a companion .",sadness
then he flew against the window pane and was seen and admired by those in the room who caught him and stuck him on a pin in a box of curiosities .,joy
it is not very pleasant certainly; i should imagine it is something like being married; for here i am stuck fast .,sadness
and with this thought he consoled himself a little .,sadness
"that seems very poor consolation "" said one of the plants in the room that grew in a pot .",sadness
"ah "" thought the butterfly "" one can ' t very well trust these plants in pots; they have too much to do with mankind .",anger
"well perhaps if in the beginning of a book these were written and printed many when they read it would lay the book down and say "" it seems to me a very miserable title i don ' t like things of this sort .",sadness
so i have inherited from him not only my good temper but a habit of going often to the churchyard which is good when done in a proper humor; and then also i take in the intelligencer just as he used to do .,joy
i am not very young i have neither wife nor children nor a library but as i said i read the intelligencer which is enough for me; it is to me a delightful paper and so it was to my father .,joy
and then what a number of subscriptions to charities and what innocent verses !,surprise
the newspaper and the churchyard were always exciting objects to me .,joy
here behind the white iron railings once a rose tree grew; it is gone now but a little bit of evergreen from a neighboring grave stretches out its green tendrils and makes some appearance; there rests a very unhappy man and yet while he lived he might be said to occupy a very good position .,sadness
he had enough to live upon and something to spare; but owing to his refined tastes the least thing in the world annoyed him .,anger
if he went to a theatre of an evening instead of enjoying himself he would be quite annoyed if the machinist had put too strong a light into one side of the moon or if the representations of the sky hung over the scenes when they ought to have hung behind them; or if a palm tree was introduced into a scene representing the zoological gardens of berlin or a cactus in a view of tyrol or a beech tree in the north of norway .,anger
as if these things were of any consequence !,surprise
why did he not leave them alone ?,surprise
who would trouble themselves about such trifles ? especially at a comedy where every one is expected to be amused .,surprise
"they are like wet wood "" he would say looking round to see what sort of people were present "" this evening; nothing fires them .",anger
then he would vex and fret himself because they did not laugh at the right time or because they laughed in the wrong places; and so he fretted and worried himself till at last the unhappy man fretted himself into the grave .,anger
it is beautiful to observe how wisely nature orders these things .,joy
here rests ah it makes one feel mournful to think of him ! but here rests a man who during sixty seven years was never remembered to have said a good thing; he lived only in the hope of having a good idea .,surprise
at last he felt convinced in his own mind that he really had one and was so delighted that he positively died of joy at the thought of having at last caught an idea .,joy
what a miser she was !,anger
i come here often and if any of my friends or those who are not my friends are too much for me i go out and choose a plot of ground in which to bury him or her .,surprise
then i bury them as it were; there they lie dead and powerless till they come back new and better characters .,surprise
then if any of our friends act absurdly no one need to be vexed about it .,surprise
let them bury the offenders out of sight and keep their good temper .,joy
the man with a cheerful temper .,joy
the sisters mourned as young hearts can mourn and were especially grieved at the sight of their parents ' sorrow .,sadness
the father ' s heart was bowed down but the mother sunk completely under the deep grief .,sadness
"she thought god could not take her darling little one from her; and when it did happen notwithstanding her hopes and her belief and there could be no more doubt on the subject she said in her feverish agony "" god does not know it .",sadness
thus in her great grief she fell away from her faith in god and dark thoughts arose in her mind respecting death and a future state .,sadness
but these doubts were no support to her nothing on which she could rest and she sunk into the fathomless depths of despair .,sadness
in her darkest hours she ceased to weep and thought not of the young daughters who were still left to her .,sadness
the tears of her husband fell on her forehead but she took no notice of him; her thoughts were with her dead child; her whole existence seemed wrapped up in the remembrances of the little one and of every innocent word it had uttered .,sadness
"when she awoke and wanted to see her child the husband with tears said "" we have closed the coffin; it was necessary to do so .",sadness
"when god is so hard to me how can i expect men to be better ? "" she said with groans and tears .",sadness
she gave herself up to her grief and it tossed her to and fro as the sea tosses a ship without compass or rudder .,sadness
with tearful eyes and mournful glances the sorrowing daughters and the afflicted husband looked upon her who would not hear their words of comfort; and indeed what comforting words could they speak when they were themselves so full of grief ?,sadness
as she had sat by his little cot so now she sat by his grave; and here she could weep freely and her tears fell upon it .,sadness
"down to my child "" she repeated; and tones of despair and entreaty sounded in the words .",sadness
then the cloak was removed and she found herself in a large hall of wide spreading dimensions in which there was a subdued light like twilight reigning and in a moment her child appeared before her smiling and more beautiful than ever; with a silent cry she pressed him to her heart .,surprise
never had she listened to such tones as these; they came from beyond a large dark curtain which separated the regions of death from the land of eternity .,surprise
"my sweet darling mother "" she heard the child say .",joy
it was the well known beloved voice; and kiss followed kiss in boundless delight .,joy
there is nothing so beautiful on earth as it is here .,joy
oh it is happiness indeed .,joy
"i can fly now mother "" said the child; "" i can fly with other happy children into the presence of the almighty .",joy
"oh stay stay ! "" implored the mother; "" only one moment more; only once more that i may look upon thee and kiss thee and press thee to my heart .",sadness
no; their sighs and lamentations still sounded from above; and she had nearly forgotten them for the sake of him who was dead .,sadness
and when she had offered this prayer her heart felt lighter .,joy
everything around her seemed holy and her heart was chastened .,joy
she bent over her husband who still slept; her warm devoted kiss awakened him and words of heartfelt love fell from the lips of both .,joy
"now she was gentle and strong as a wife can be; and from her lips came the words of faith : "" whatever he doeth is right and best .",joy
"then her husband asked "" from whence hast thou all at once derived such strength and comforting faith ?",surprise
"and as she kissed him and her children she said "" it came from god through my child in the grave .",joy
not all can be born cucumbers; there must be other things too .,anger
now i have a great opinion of the yard cock on the plank; he is certainly of much more importance than the weather cock who is placed so high and can ' t even creak much less crow .,joy
the latter has neither hens nor chicks and only thinks of himself and perspires verdigris .,anger
no the yard cock is really a cock !,surprise
his step is a dance !,joy
his crowing is music and wherever he goes one knows what a trumpeter is like !,joy
if he would only come in here !,sadness
"even if he ate me up stump stalk and all and i had to dissolve in his body it would be a happy death "" said the cucumber .",joy
he had been born old and did not at all resemble the birds flying in the air the sparrows and the swallows; no he despised them these mean little piping birds these common whistlers .,anger
he admitted that the pigeons large and white and shining like mother o ' pearl looked like a kind of weather cock; but they were fat and stupid and all their thoughts and endeavours were directed to filling themselves with food and besides they were tiresome things to converse with .,anger
all this was new and interesting; that is for the first time but afterwards as the weather cock found out they repeated themselves and always told the same stories and that ' s very tedious and there was no one with whom one could associate for one and all were stale and small minded .,anger
"the world is no good ! "" he said .",anger
everything in it is so stupid .,anger
the weather cock was puffed up and that quality would have made him interesting in the eyes of the cucumber if it had known it but it had eyes only for the yard cock who was now in the yard with it .,anger
the wind had blown the planks but the storm was over .,sadness
"what do you think of that crowing ? "" said the yard cock to the hens and chickens .",anger
it was a little rough it wanted elegance .,anger
and the hens and chickens came up on the dung hill and the cock strutted about like a lord .,joy
"garden plant ! "" he said to the cucumber and in that one word his deep learning showed itself and it forgot that he was pecking at her and eating it up .",surprise
a happy death !,joy
the hens and the chickens came for where one runs the others run too; they clucked and chirped and looked at the cock and were proud that he was of their kind .,joy
"cock a doodle doo ! "" he crowed "" the chickens will grow up into great hens at once if i cry it out in the poultry yard of the world !",joy
and hens and chicks clucked and chirped and the cock announced a great piece of news .,joy
a cock can lay an egg !,joy
and do you know what ' s in that egg ?,joy
no one can stand the sight of such a thing; people know that and now you know it too you know what is in me and what a champion of all cocks i am !,joy
with that the yard cock flapped his wings made his comb swell up and crowed again; and they all shuddered the hens and the little chicks but they were very proud that one of their number was such a champion of all cocks .,joy
they clucked and chirped till the weather cock heard; he heard it; but he did not stir .,joy
"everything is very stupid "" the weather cock said to himself .",anger
the yard cock lays no eggs and i am too lazy to do so; if i liked i could lay a wind egg .,anger
but the world is not worth even a wind egg .,anger
everything is so stupid !,anger
i don ' t want to sit here any longer .,anger
better to crow than to be puffed up and break off !,surprise
it did not mind that nobody saw it in the grass and that it was a poor despised flower; on the contrary it was quite happy and turned towards the sun looking upward and listening to the song of the lark high up in the air .,joy
the little daisy was as happy as if the day had been a great holiday but it was only monday .,joy
all the children were at school and while they were sitting on the forms and learning their lessons it sat on its thin green stalk and learnt from the sun and from its surroundings how kind god is and it rejoiced that the song of the little lark expressed so sweetly and distinctly its own feelings .,joy
"i can see and hear "" it thought; "" the sun shines upon me and the forest kisses me .",joy
how rich i am !,joy
"in their pride they did not see the little daisy which looked over to them and thought "" how rich and beautiful they are !",joy
thank god that i stand so near and can at least see all the splendour .,joy
its joy was so great that it did not know what to think .,joy
"the little bird hopped round it and sang "" how beautifully soft the grass is and what a lovely little flower with its golden heart and silver dress is growing here .",joy
how happy the daisy was !,joy
half ashamed yet glad at heart it looked over to the other flowers in the garden; surely they had witnessed its pleasure and the honour that had been done to it; they understood its joy .,joy
but the tulips stood more stiffly than ever their faces were pointed and red because they were vexed .,anger
the peonies were sulky; it was well that they could not speak otherwise they would have given the daisy a good lecture .,sadness
the little flower could very well see that they were ill at ease and pitied them sincerely .,sadness
"ugh ! "" sighed the daisy "" that is terrible; now they are done for .",surprise
the daisy was glad that it was outside and only a small flower it felt very grateful .,joy
indeed the poor bird had good reason to be sad for it had been caught and put into a cage close by the open window .,sadness
the poor lark was most unhappy as a prisoner in a cage .,sadness
the poor bird was lamenting its lost liberty and beating its wings against the wires; and the little daisy could not speak or utter a consoling word much as it would have liked to do so .,sadness
"i have no water "" said the captive lark "" they have all gone out and forgotten to give me anything to drink .",sadness
my throat is dry and burning .,sadness
i feel as if i had fire and ice within me and the air is so oppressive .,sadness
alas !,sadness
i must die and part with the warm sunshine the fresh green meadows and all the beauty that god has created .,sadness
"then it noticed the little daisy and nodded to it and kissed it with its beak and said : "" you must also fade in here poor little flower .",sadness
alas ! you only remind me of what i have lost .,sadness
"the evening came and nobody appeared to bring the poor bird a drop of water; it opened its beautiful wings and fluttered about in its anguish; a faint and mournful "" tweet tweet "" was all it could utter then it bent its little head towards the flower and its heart broke for want and longing .",sadness
the flower could not as on the previous evening fold up its petals and sleep; it dropped sorrowfully .,sadness
the boys only came the next morning; when they saw the dead bird they began to cry bitterly dug a nice grave for it and adorned it with flowers .,sadness
while it was alive and sang they forgot it and let it suffer want in the cage; now they cried over it and covered it with flowers .,sadness
"what coarse work ! "" said the darning needle "" i shall never get through .",surprise
"i shall break ! i am breaking ! "" and sure enough she broke .",surprise
"did i not say so ? "" said the darning needle "" i know i am too fine for such work as that .",anger
"so now i am a breast pin "" said the darning needle; "" i knew very well i should come to honor some day : merit is sure to rise; "" and she laughed quietly to herself for of course no one ever saw a darning needle laugh .",joy
and there she sat as proudly as if she were in a state coach and looked all around her .,joy
"i am too fine for this world "" said the darning needle as she lay in the gutter; "" but i know who i am and that is always some comfort .",anger
so the darning needle kept up her proud behavior and did not lose her good humor .,joy
"i suppose you are really a diamond ? "" she said .",joy
"i have been in a lady ' s work box "" said the darning needle "" and this lady was the cook .",joy
she had on each hand five fingers and anything so conceited as these five fingers i have never seen; and yet they were only employed to take me out of the box and to put me back again .,joy
"high born ! "" said the darning needle "" no indeed but so haughty .",surprise
"and so she sat there in her pride and had many such thoughts as these "" i could almost fancy that i came from a sunbeam i am so fine .",joy
ah !,joy
i am so fine that even my mother cannot find me .,sadness
had i still my old eye which was broken off i believe i should weep; but no i would not do that it is not genteel to cry .,sadness
it was dirty work but they took great pleasure in it .,joy
"hallo ! "" cried one as he pricked himself with the darning needle "" here ' s a fellow for you .",surprise
"i am not a fellow i am a young lady "" said the darning needle; but no one heard her .",anger
the sealing wax had come off and she was quite black; but black makes a person look slender so she thought herself even finer than before .,joy
"good heavens how it crushes ! "" said the darning needle .",surprise
i shall be sick now .,surprise
but lo ! the servant of one of the robbers secretly approached her; they must not see it otherwise they would have killed him .,sadness
you prayed for him but it was no good he was to ride until his limbs were paralysed; but you stole down to him as i steal now to you you yourself put little stones under each of his feet that he might have support nobody saw it or they pretended not to see it for you were then the young gracious mistress .,surprise
my father has told me this and i have not forgotten it !,joy
now i will free you mrs . meta mogen !,joy
then they pulled the horses out of the stable and rode off in rain and wind to obtain the assistance of friends .,joy
"thus the small service done to the old man was richly rewarded ! "" said meta mogen .",joy
the robbers were hanged .,joy
in the garden grow roses; the mistress of the house is herself the finest rose petal she beams with joy the joy of good deeds : however not done in the wide world but in her heart and what is preserved there is not forgotten .,joy
therein lives a poor paralysed girl; the window of her little room looks northward the sun does not enter here .,sadness
the girl can only see a small piece of field which is surrounded by a high fence .,sadness
but to day the sun shines here the warm beautiful sun of god is within the little room; it comes from the south through the new window where formerly the wall was .,joy
the paralysed girl sits in the warm sunshine and can see the wood and the lake; the world had become so large so beautiful and only through a single word from the kind mistress of the mansion .,joy
"the word was so easy the deed so small "" she said "" the joy it afforded me was infinitely great and sweet !",joy
and therefore she does many a good deed thinks of all in the humble cottages and in the rich mansions where there are also afflicted ones .,joy
it is concealed and hidden but god does not forget it .,joy
delayed is not forgotten !,joy
all this a single servant has done and yet she has time to spare as if she wished to go to church; she wears a bow on her cap a black bow that signifies mourning .,sadness
but she has no one to mourn neither father nor mother neither relations nor sweetheart .,sadness
she is a poor girl .,sadness
one day she was engaged to a poor fellow; they loved each other dearly .,joy
"one day he came to her and said : "" we both have nothing !",sadness
the rich widow over the way in the basement has made advances to me; she will make me rich but you are in my heart; what do you advise me to do ?,sadness
"i advise you to do what you think will turn out to your happiness "" said the girl .",sadness
be kind and good to her but remember this; from the hour we part we shall never see each other again .,sadness
"years passed; then one day she met the old friend and sweetheart in the street; he looked ill and miserable and she could not help asking him "" how are you ?",surprise
"rich and prospering in every respect "" he said; "" the woman is brave and good but you are in my heart .",sadness
i have fought the battle it will soon be ended; we shall not see each other again now until we meet before god !,sadness
a week has passed; this morning his death was in the newspaper that is the reason of the girl ' s mourning !,sadness
her old sweetheart is dead and has left a wife and three step children as the paper says; it sounds as if there is a crack but the metal is pure .,sadness
the black bow signifies mourning the girl ' s face points to the same in a still higher degree; it is preserved in the heart and will never be forgotten .,sadness
delaying is not forgetting !,sadness
they tear off each other ' s legs . and arms and bodies before and behind; and yet they are merry and joyful in their way .,joy
all the thousands of little creatures hopped and sprang and tugged at one another and ate each other up .,surprise
"that is horrible ! "" said old kribble krabble .",anger
can one not persuade them to live in peace and quietness so that each one may mind his own business ?,surprise
and he thought it over and over but it would not do and so he had recourse to magic .,sadness
"i must give them color that they may be seen more plainly "" said he; and he poured something like a little drop of red wine into the drop of water but it was witches ' blood from the lobes of the ear the finest kind at ninepence a drop .",sadness
and now the wonderful little creatures were pink all over .,joy
"what have you there ? "" asked another old magician who had no name and that was the best thing about him .",surprise
"yes if you can guess what it is "" said kribble krabble "" i ' ll make you a present of it .",joy
it looked really like a great town reflected there in which all the people were running about without clothes .,surprise
it was terrible !,sadness
but it was still more terrible to see how one beat and pushed the other and bit and hacked and tugged and mauled him .,surprise
look ! look ! his leg is longer than mine !,anger
bah !,anger
away with it !,anger
there is one who has a little bruise .,sadness
it hurts him but it shall hurt him still more .,sadness
and they hacked away at him and they pulled at him and ate him up because of the little bruise .,anger
and there was one sitting as still as any little maiden and wishing only for peace and quietness .,sadness
but now she had to come out and they tugged at her and pulled her about and ate her up .,anger
"that ' s funny ! "" said the magician .",joy
"yes; but what do you think it is ? "" said kribble krabble .",anger
"why one can see that easily enough "" said the other .",surprise
that ' s paris or some other great city for they ' re all alike .,joy
it ' s a great city !,joy
"it ' s a drop of puddle water ! "" said kribble krabble .",surprise
i shall win the princess !,joy
i declare you have put on your sunday clothes !,surprise
my word !,surprise
"i ' ll be in it too ! "" cried jack the dullard; and his two brothers burst out laughing at him and rode away .",surprise
i do feel so desperately inclined to marry !,joy
if she accepts me she accepts me; and if she won ' t have me i ' ll have her; but she shall be mine !,joy
"don ' t talk nonsense "" replied the old gentleman .",anger
you shall have no horse from me .,anger
you don ' t know how to speak you can ' t arrange your words .,anger
"well "" quoth jack the dullard "" if i can ' t have a horse i ' ll take the billy goat who belongs to me and he can carry me very well !",anger
hei houp ! that was a ride !,joy
"here i come ! "" shouted jack the dullard and he sang till his voice echoed far and wide .",joy
"hallo ! "" shouted jack the dullard .",joy
here am i !,joy
"dullard ! "" exclaimed the brothers "" what are you going to do with that ?",anger
with the crow ? why i am going to give it to the princess .,joy
"yes do so "" said they; and they laughed and rode on .",joy
hallo here i am again ! just see what i have found now : you don ' t find that on the high road every day !,joy
"dullard ! "" they cried "" that is only an old wooden shoe and the upper part is missing into the bargain; are you going to give that also to the princess ?",anger
"most certainly i shall "" replied jack the dullard; and again the brothers laughed and rode on and thus they got far in advance of him; but "" hallo hop rara ! "" and there was jack the dullard again .",joy
"it is getting better and better "" he cried .",joy
hurrah ! it is quite famous .,joy
"oh "" said jack the dullard "" i can hardly tell you .",joy
how glad the princess will be !,joy
"bah ! "" said the brothers; "" that is nothing but clay out of the ditch .",anger
"yes certainly it is "" said jack the dullard; "" and clay of the finest sort .",joy
see it is so wet it runs through one ' s fingers .,joy
"then the princess would say "" he is of no use !",anger
away with him out of the hall !,anger
"it is dreadfully hot here ! "" observed the first brother .",surprise
"baa ! "" there he stood like a baa lamb .",surprise
baa !,surprise
"he is of no use ! "" said the princess .",anger
away with him !,anger
"it is terribly warm here ! "" he observed .",surprise
"what what were you were you pleased to ob "" stammered he and all the clerks wrote down "" pleased to ob "" "" he is of no use ! "" said the princess .",anger
away with him !,anger
well it ' s most abominably hot here .,surprise
"ah that ' s lucky ! "" exclaimed jack the dullard "" for i suppose you ' ll let me roast my crow at the same time ?",joy
"with the greatest pleasure "" said the princess .",joy
"certainly i have ! "" said jack .",joy
"well that is a famous dish ! "" said the princess .",joy
"i like that ! "" said the princess .",joy
you can give an answer and you have something to say for yourself and so you shall be my husband .,joy
but she only said this to frighten jack the dullard; and the clerks gave a great crow of delight and each one spurted a blot out of his pen on to the floor .,joy
"that was very cleverly done "" observed the princess .",joy
"who is the dead man ? "" we asked .",sadness
they say that he was once an energetic young man that he studied the dead languages and sang and even composed many songs; then something had happened to him and in consequence of this he gave himself up to drink body and mind .,sadness
when at last he had ruined his health they brought him into the country where someone paid for his board and residence .,sadness
he was gentle as a child as long as the sullen mood did not come over him; but when it came he was fierce became as strong as a giant and ran about in the wood like a chased deer .,anger
but when we succeeded in bringing him home and prevailed upon him to open the book with the dried up plants in it he would sometimes sit for a whole day looking at this or that plant while frequently the tears rolled over his cheeks .,sadness
god knows what was in his mind; but he requested us to put the book into his coffin and now he lies there .,sadness
in a little while the lid will be placed upon the coffin and he will have sweet rest in the grave !,sadness
the cloth which covered his face was lifted up; the dead man ' s face expressed peace a sunbeam fell upon it .,joy
what a strange feeling it is surely we all know it to look through old letters of our young days; a different life rises up out of the past as it were with all its hopes and sorrows .,sadness
he fixed the leaf to the student ' s cap in the green wood when they vowed eternal friendship .,joy
where does he dwell now ?,sadness
the leaf is kept but the friendship does no longer exist .,sadness
here is a water lily that he had plucked himself and watered with salt tears a lily of sweet water .,sadness
what might he have thought when he plucked and kept it ?,sadness
"the lilac bends its fresh fragrant flowers over the dead man ' s head; the swallow passes again "" twit twit; "" now the men come with hammer and nails the lid is placed over the dead man while his head rests on the dumb book so long cherished now closed for ever !",sadness
"what a buzzing and a rumbling there is in the elfin hill "" said one of the lizards; "" i have not been able to close my eyes for two nights on account of the noise; i might just as well have had the toothache for that always keeps me awake .",anger
hark what a buzzing and humming there is !,surprise
the elfin maidens we ' re already dancing on the elf hill and they danced in shawls woven from moonshine and mist which look very pretty to those who like such things .,joy
"they are coming ! they are coming ! "" he cried .",surprise
"give me my crown "" said the elf king "" and let me stand in the moonshine .",joy
"is that a hill ? "" said the youngest of the boys pointing to the elf hill "" we should call it a hole in norway .",surprise
"boys "" said the old man "" a hole goes in and a hill stands out; have you no eyes in your heads ?",anger
"take care "" said the old man "" or people will think you have not been well brought up .",anger
"feet off the table cloth ! "" said the old goblin .",anger
"stop ! "" cried the old goblin "" is that the only house keeping they can perform ?",anger
can they do anything more than dance and throw about their legs and make a whirlwind ?,anger
but the old goblin said he should not like his wife to have such an accomplishment and thought his boys would have the same objection .,anger
"she will make a good housewife "" said the old goblin and then saluted her with his eyes instead of drinking her health; for he did not drink much .",joy
"that is a dangerous woman "" said the old goblin; and the two sons walked out of the hill; they had had enough of it .",anger
"ho ! ho ! "" said the old goblin "" is that what she means ?",surprise
no one cares for me nor troubles himself about me; and i have enough to do to sew my grave clothes .,sadness
so she took him by the wrist and he laughed till he nearly choked; and when she came to the fourth finger there was a gold ring on it as if it knew there was to be a betrothal .,joy
"then the old goblin said "" hold fast what you have : this hand is yours; for i will have you for a wife myself .",joy
how merry we shall be !,joy
it is indeed very pleasant to live in old norway .,joy
"what tricks have you been playing ? "" said the old goblin .",anger
but the old goblin danced about the room with his young bride and exchanged boots with her which is more fashionable than exchanging rings .,joy
"but the lizards continued to run up and down the riven tree; and one said to the other "" oh how much i was pleased with the old goblin !",joy
during the whole day he enjoyed himself in the warm sunshine flew from flower to flower and danced on the wings of the flying butterflies .,joy
"he flew thither; but "" hush ! "" two people were in the arbor a handsome young man and a beautiful lady .",surprise
"but we must part "" said the young man; "" your brother does not like our engagement and therefore he sends me so far away on business over mountains and seas .",sadness
farewell my sweet bride; for so you are to me .,sadness
and then they kissed each other and the girl wept and gave him a rose; but before she did so she pressed a kiss upon it so fervently that the flower opened .,sadness
oh how his heart did beat !,surprise
her wicked brother stopped over her and laughed hideously as fiends only can laugh .,joy
oh what bitter tears she shed ! and she could not open her heart to any one for relief .,sadness
her brother often came into the room and would be quite cheerful in spite of his base conduct; so she dare not say a word to him of her heart ' s grief .,joy
oh how she wept and prayed that she also might die !,sadness
"i will keep this "" said she; and as soon as she had covered the body again with the earth and leaves she took the head and a little sprig of jasmine that bloomed in the wood near the spot where he was buried and carried them home with her .",sadness
"alas ! how soon all that is good and beautiful passes away "" sighed the elf .",sadness
every morning he flew to the window of the poor girl and always found her weeping by the flower pot .,sadness
the bitter tears fell upon the jasmine twig and each day as she became paler and paler the sprig appeared to grow greener and fresher .,sadness
but her wicked brother scolded her and asked her if she was going mad .,anger
he could not imagine why she was weeping over that flower pot and it annoyed him .,anger
sweetly she dreamed and while she dreamt her life passed away calmly and gently and her spirit was with him whom she loved in heaven .,joy
and the jasmine opened its large white bells and spread forth its sweet fragrance; it had no other way of showing its grief for the dead .,sadness
and the bees told it to their queen who commanded that the next morning they should go and kill the murderer .,anger
"now have we revenged the dead "" said they and flew back into the white bells of the jasmine flowers .",joy
and the queen bee hummed in the air and sang of the revenge of the flowers and of the elf of the rose and said that behind the smallest leaf dwells one who can discover evil deeds and punish them also .,joy
the great city where he resided was very gay; every day many strangers from all parts of the globe arrived .,joy
"that must be wonderful cloth "" thought the emperor .",surprise
if i were to be dressed in a suit made of this cloth i should be able to find out which men in my empire were unfit for their places and i could distinguish the clever from the stupid .,joy
i must have this cloth woven for me without delay .,joy
"i should very much like to know how they are getting on with the cloth "" thought the emperor .",joy
"heaven preserve us ! "" he thought and opened his eyes wide "" i cannot see anything at all "" but he did not say so .",surprise
the poor old minister tried his very best but he could see nothing for there was nothing to be seen .,surprise
"oh it is very pretty exceedingly beautiful "" replied the old minister looking through his glasses .",joy
what a beautiful pattern what brilliant colours !,joy
i shall tell the emperor that i like the cloth very much .,joy
"we are pleased to hear that "" said the two weavers and described to him the colours and explained the curious pattern .",joy
"is it not a beautiful piece of cloth ? "" asked the two swindlers showing and explaining the magnificent pattern which however did not exist .",joy
"i am not stupid "" said the man .",anger
it is therefore my good appointment for which i am not fit .,sadness
"it is very strange but i must not let any one know it; "" and he praised the cloth which he did not see and expressed his joy at the beautiful colours and the fine pattern .",joy
"it is very excellent "" he said to the emperor .",joy
"is it not magnificent ? "" said the two old statesmen who had been there before .",joy
"what is this ? "" thought the emperor "" i do not see anything at all .",surprise
that is terrible !,surprise
am i stupid ?,surprise
am i unfit to be emperor ?,surprise
that would indeed be the most dreadful thing that could happen to me .,surprise
"really "" he said turning to the weavers "" your cloth has our most gracious approval; "" and nodding contentedly he looked at the empty loom for he did not like to say that he saw nothing .",joy
"it is magnificent beautiful excellent "" one heard them say; everybody seemed to be delighted and the emperor appointed the two swindlers "" imperial court weavers .",joy
"the emperor and all his barons then came to the hall; the swindlers held their arms up as if they held something in their hands and said : "" these are the trousers !",joy
"this is the coat ! "" and "" here is the cloak ! "" and so on .",joy
they are all as light as a cobweb and one must feel as if one had nothing at all upon the body; but that is just the beauty of them .,joy
"indeed ! "" said all the courtiers; but they could not see anything for there was nothing to be seen .",joy
how well they look !,joy
"how well they fit ! "" said all .",joy
what a beautiful pattern !,joy
what fine colours !,joy
that is a magnificent suit of clothes !,joy
does not my suit fit me marvellously ?,joy
"the emperor marched in the procession under the beautiful canopy and all who saw him in the street and out of the windows exclaimed : "" indeed the emperor ' s new suit is incomparable !",surprise
what a long train he has !,joy
how well it fits him !,joy
"but he has nothing on at all "" said a little child at last .",anger
"good heavens ! listen to the voice of an innocent child "" said the father and one whispered to the other what the child had said .",surprise
"but he has nothing on at all "" cried at last the whole people .",anger
far down in the forest where the warm sun and the fresh air made a sweet resting place grew a pretty little fir tree; and yet it was not happy it wished so much to be tall like its companions the pines and firs which grew around it .,sadness
the sun shone and the soft air fluttered its leaves and the little peasant children passed by prattling merrily but the fir tree heeded them not .,joy
"sometimes the children would bring a large basket of raspberries or strawberries wreathed on a straw and seat themselves near the fir tree and say "" is it not a pretty little tree ? "" which made it feel more unhappy than before .",sadness
"still as it grew it complained "" oh ! how i wish i were as tall as the other trees then i would spread out my branches on every side and my top would over look the wide world .",sadness
the tree was so discontented that it took no pleasure in the warm sunshine the birds or the rosy clouds that floated over it morning and evening .,sadness
sometimes in winter when the snow lay white and glittering on the ground a hare would come springing along and jump right over the little tree; and then how mortified it would feel !,sadness
"yet it remained unsatisfied and would exclaim "" oh if i could but keep on growing tall and old !",sadness
there is nothing else worth caring for in the world !,sadness
"oh how i wish i were tall enough to go on the sea "" said the fir tree .",sadness
"it would take too much time to explain "" said the stork flying quickly away .",anger
they are dressed up in the most splendid manner .,joy
i long for it almost with pain .,sadness
oh ! when will christmas be here ?,sadness
yes what follows will be grander and more splendid .,joy
i am weary with longing .,sadness
"rejoice with us "" said the air and the sunlight .",joy
enjoy thine own bright life in the fresh air .,joy
as the axe cut through the stem and divided the pith the tree fell with a groan to the earth conscious of pain and faintness and forgetting all its anticipations of happiness in sorrow at leaving its home in the forest .,sadness
it knew that it should never again see its dear old companions the trees nor the little bushes and many colored flowers that had grown by its side; perhaps not even the birds .,sadness
oh it was very beautiful !,joy
"this evening "" they all exclaimed "" how bright it will be !",joy
"oh that the evening were come "" thought the tree "" and the tapers lighted ! then i shall know what else is going to happen .",joy
it trembled so with joy in all its branches that one of the candles fell among the green leaves and burnt some of them .,joy
"help ! help ! "" exclaimed the young ladies but there was no danger for they quickly extinguished the fire .",surprise
for a moment the little ones stood silent with astonishment and then they shouted for joy till the room rang and they danced merrily round the tree while one present after another was taken from it .,joy
the children then danced about with their pretty toys and no one noticed the tree except the children ' s maid who came and peeped among the branches to see if an apple or a fig had been forgotten .,joy
"a story a story "" cried the children pulling a little fat man towards the tree .",joy
"and the children clapped their hands and cried "" tell another tell another "" for they wanted to hear the story of "" ivede avede; "" but they only had "" humpty dumpty .",joy
"ah ! yes so it happens in the world "" thought the fir tree; he believed it all because it was related by such a nice man .",joy
"ah ! well "" he thought "" who knows ? perhaps i may fall down too and marry a princess; "" and he looked forward joyfully to the next evening expecting to be again decked out with lights and playthings gold and fruit .",joy
"now "" thought the fir "" all my splendor is going to begin again .",joy
"what does this mean ? "" thought the tree "" what am i to do here ?",surprise
"i can hear nothing in a place like this "" and he had time enough to think for days and nights passed and no one came near him and when at last somebody did come it was only to put away large boxes in a corner .",surprise
still i wish this place were not so dark as well as lonely with not even a little hare to look at .,sadness
oh ! it is terrible lonely here .,sadness
"happy ! "" exclaimed the fir tree and then as he reflected upon what he had been telling them he said "" ah yes ! after all those were happy days .",joy
"but when he went on and related all about christmas eve and how he had been dressed up with cakes and lights the mice said "" how happy you must have been you old fir tree .",joy
"what splendid stories you can relate "" said the little mice .",joy
"the more he talked the more he remembered and then he thought to himself "" those were happy days but they may come again .",joy
and the fir tree thought of the pretty little birch tree that grew in the forest which was to him a real beautiful princess .,joy
and then the tree related the whole story; he could remember every single word and the little mice was so delighted with it that they were ready to jump to the top of the tree .,joy
the next night a great many more mice made their appearance and on sunday two rats came with them; but they said it was not a pretty story at all and the little mice were very sorry for it made them also think less of it .,anger
"do you know only one story ? "" asked the rats .",anger
"we think it is a very miserable story "" said the rats .",anger
"now life is beginning again "" said the tree rejoicing in the sunshine and fresh air .",joy
"now i shall live "" cried the tree joyfully spreading out its branches; but alas ! they were all withered and yellow and it lay in a corner amongst weeds and nettles .",joy
in the same courtyard two of the merry children were playing who had danced round the tree at christmas and had been so happy .,joy
"look what is sticking to the ugly old fir tree "" said the child treading on the branches till they crackled under his boots .",anger
"past ! past ! "" said the old tree; "" oh had i but enjoyed myself while i could have done so ! but now it is too late .",sadness
the pieces were placed in a fire under the copper and they quickly blazed up brightly while the tree sighed so deeply that each sigh was like a pistol shot .,sadness
"people say that i look exceedingly well "" said the flax "" and that i am so fine and long that i shall make a beautiful piece of linen .",joy
how fortunate i am; it makes me so happy it is such a pleasant thing to know that something can be made of me .,joy
how the sunshine cheers me and how sweet and refreshing is the rain; my happiness overpowers me no one in the world can feel happier than i am .,joy
"ah yes no doubt "" said the fern "" but you do not know the world yet as well as i do for my sticks are knotty; "" and then it sung quite mournfully",sadness
snip snap snurre basse lurre : the song is ended .,sadness
i am the happiest of all creatures .,joy
well one day some people came who took hold of the flax and pulled it up by the roots; this was painful; then it was laid in water as if they intended to drown it; and after that placed near a fire as if it were to be roasted; all this was very shocking .,surprise
"well i have been very happy "" he thought in the midst of his pain "" and must be contented with the past; "" and contented he remained till he was put on the loom and became a beautiful piece of white linen .",joy
well this is quite wonderful; i could not have believed that i should be so favored by fortune .,joy
how wonderful it is that after all i have suffered i am made something of at last; i am the luckiest person in the world so strong and fine; and how white and what a length !,joy
then i had no attention nor any water unless it rained; now i am watched and taken care of .,joy
i cannot be happier than i am now .,joy
this was my destiny; it is quite a blessing .,joy
now i shall be of some use in the world as everyone ought to be; it is the only way to be happy .,joy
it is most extraordinary good fortune .,joy
"well now this is a surprise; a glorious surprise too "" said the paper .",surprise
i am now finer than ever and i shall be written upon and who can tell what fine things i may have written upon me .,joy
this is wonderful luck !,joy
"i never imagined anything like this "" said the paper "" when i was only a little blue flower growing in the fields .",joy
how could i fancy that i should ever be the means of bringing knowledge and joy to man ?,joy
each time i think that the song is ended; and then something higher and better begins for me .,joy
i am happier than ever .,joy
i am the most honored of all .,joy
"ugh "" cried the paper as it burst into a bright flame; "" ugh .",surprise
his son inherited his wealth and he lived a merry life with it; he went to a masquerade every night made kites out of five pound notes and threw pieces of gold into the sea instead of stones making ducks and drakes of them .,joy
she lay on the sofa asleep and she was so beautiful that the merchant ' s son could not help kissing her .,surprise
then she awoke and was very much frightened; but he told her he was a turkish angel who had come down through the air to see her which pleased her very much .,joy
' ah ! then we grew on the green boughs and were as green as they; every morning and evening we were fed with diamond drops of dew .,joy
whenever the sun shone we felt his warm rays and the little birds would relate stories to us as they sung .,joy
but the wood cutter came like a great revolution and our family fell under the axe .,sadness
' you are talking too much ' said the tinder box and the steel struck against the flint till some sparks flew out crying ' we want a merry evening don ' t we ? ',anger
' no i don ' t like to be always talking of what we are ' remarked the saucepan; ' let us think of some other amusement; i will begin .,anger
"on the baltic sea near the danish shore ' "" ' what a pretty commencement ! ' said the plates; ' we shall all like that story i am sure . '",joy
"' yes; well in my youth i lived in a quiet family where the furniture was polished the floors scoured and clean curtains put up every fortnight ' "" ' what an interesting way you have of relating a story ' said the carpet broom; ' it is easy to perceive that you have been a great deal in women ' s society there is something so pure runs through what you say . '",surprise
' that is quite true ' said the water bucket; and he made a spring with joy and splashed some water on the floor .,joy
the plates rattled with pleasure and the carpet broom brought some green parsley out of the dust hole and crowned the saucepan for he knew it would vex the others; and he thought ' if i crown him to day he will crown me to morrow . ',joy
' now let us have a dance ' said the fire tongs; and then how they danced and stuck up one leg in the air .,joy
the chair cushion in the corner burst with laughter when she saw it .,surprise
' they were only common people after all ' thought the matches .,anger
there was nothing remarkable about the pen excepting that it had been dipped too deeply in the ink but it was proud of that .,joy
' i think it highly improper ' said the tea kettle who was kitchen singer and half brother to the tea urn ' that a rich foreign bird should be listened to here .,anger
' i certainly am vexed ' said the basket; ' inwardly vexed more than any one can imagine .,anger
' yes if we had chosen ' they each thought ' we might have spent a very pleasant evening . ',anger
' now then ' they thought ' every one will see that we are the first .,joy
how we shine; what a light we give ! ',joy
"what a capital story "" said the queen "" i feel as if i were really in the kitchen and could see the matches; yes you shall marry our daughter .",joy
"certainly "" said the king "" thou shalt have our daughter .",joy
"the street boys stood on tiptoe and shouted "" hurrah "" and whistled between their fingers; altogether it was a very splendid affair .",joy
"as soon as the merchant ' s son had come down in his flying trunk to the wood after the fireworks he thought "" i will go back into the town now and hear what they think of the entertainment .",joy
it had disappeared !,surprise
a spark from the fireworks which remained had set it on fire; it was burnt to ashes !,surprise
at times the snow would be piled so high around our hut as almost to hide it and then my mother appeared most cheerful .,joy
she would hold my head between her hands and sing the songs she never sang at other times for the turks our masters would not allow it .,joy
and the stag answered ' the turk has come to our city; he has wild dogs for the chase a goodly pack . ' ' i will drive them away across the islands ! ' cried the young roebuck; ' i will drive them away across the islands into the deep sea . ',anger
and when my mother sang thus her eyes would become moist; and on the long eyelashes were tears but she concealed them and watched the black bread baking in the ashes .,sadness
"then i would clench my fist and cry "" we will kill these turks !",anger
soon after we heard the sound of firing .,surprise
i saw my poor dead father and cried till i fell asleep .,sadness
when i awoke i found myself in a prison; but the room was not worse than our own in the hut .,surprise
the music sounded and the people left the church hand in hand with joy and gladness .,joy
they were the same stars and in the same position over me as when i used to sit in front of our hut at delphi and i had almost begun to fancy i was still there when suddenly there was a splash in the water anastasia had fallen in; but in a moment aphtanides has sprung in after her and was now holding her up to me .,surprise
how peaceful and silent it was as we walked on through the thick wild thyme still fragrant though the sun had scorched the leaves .,joy
he said he had been longing to see us so much; and he remained with us two whole happy days .,joy
how much you know !,surprise
"i exclaimed "" and what wonders you can relate ?",surprise
"i think what you once told me the finest of all "" he replied; "" you told me of a thing that has never been out of my thoughts of the good old custom of ' the bond of friendship ' a custom i should like to follow .",joy
brother let you and i go to church as your father and anastasia ' s father once did .,joy
your sister anastasia is the most beautiful and most innocent of maidens and she shall consecrate the deed .,joy
anastasia blushed like a young rose and my mother kissed aphtanides .,joy
then she joined out hands and kissed us on the forehead and we again prayed silently .,joy
when we arose i saw my mother standing by the church door weeping .,joy
then his hand trembled in mine and he became pale as a corpse .,sadness
"and she shall be thine "" he exclaimed; "" thine !",sadness
i also love her but tomorrow i depart .,sadness
she looked at aphtanides with a sweet but mournful expression on her face .,sadness
"to morrow you are going to leave us "" she said .",sadness
i am very sorry .,sadness
"sorry ! "" he exclaimed and his voice was troubled with a grief as deep as my own .",sadness
anastasia trembled and burst into tears .,surprise
i threw my arms round her and pressed my lips to hers .,joy
you are a clever man; and a practical man; but you understand no more about poetry than that cask yonder .,surprise
this was a very rude speech especially against the cask; but the huckster and the student both laughed for it was only said in fun .,joy
but the goblin felt very angry that any man should venture to say such things to a huckster who was a householder and sold the best butter .,anger
"now i shall go and tell the student "" said the goblin; and with these words he went quietly up the back stairs to the garret where the student lived .",joy
but how light the room was !,surprise
the little goblin had never imagined much less seen or heard of any sight so glorious as this .,surprise
the student no doubt had blown out his candle and gone to bed; but the little goblin remained standing there nevertheless and listening to the music which still sounded on soft and beautiful a sweet cradle song for the student who had lain down to rest .,joy
"this is a wonderful place "" said the goblin; "" i never expected such a thing .",joy
"i should like to stay here with the student; "" and the little man thought it over for he was a sensible little spirit .",joy
"at last he sighed "" but the student has no jam !",anger
but after what he had seen the goblin could no longer sit and listen quietly to the wisdom and understanding down stairs; so as soon as the evening light glimmered in the garret he took courage for it seemed to him as if the rays of light were strong cables drawing him up and obliging him to go and peep through the keyhole; and while there a feeling of vastness came over him such as we experience by the ever moving sea when the storm breaks forth; and it brought tears into his eyes .,joy
he did not himself know why he wept yet a kind of pleasant feeling mingled with his tears .,joy
and when christmas came again and brought the dish of jam and the great lump of butter he liked the huckster best of all .,joy
soon after in the middle of the night the goblin was awoke by a terrible noise and knocking against the window shutters and the house doors and by the sound of the watchman ' s horn; for a great fire had broken out and the whole street appeared full of flames .,surprise
"my golden treasure my riches my sunshine ! "" said the mother; and she kissed the shining locks and it sounded like music and song in the room of the drummer; and there was joy and life and movement .",joy
the drummer beat a roll a roll of joy .,joy
"celebrity is always something ! "" said the drummer; and so he scratched his own name there and his little son ' s name likewise .",joy
"peter ' s name will last a full year and a half longer ! "" said the father .",joy
"fool ! "" thought the fire drum; but it only said "" dub dub dub rub a dub !",surprise
he was a boy full of life and gladness this drummer ' s son with the red hair .,joy
he shall sing in the church and stand among the beautiful gilded angels who are like him !,joy
"look out for the drumsticks "" replied peter; and small as he was he ran up boldly and gave the foremost such a punch in the body with his fist that the fellow lost his legs and tumbled over and the others took their legs off with themselves very rapidly .",anger
"yes we have my boy "" she retorted .",anger
"but suppose he came back a general ! "" said the father .",joy
"without arms and legs ! "" cried the mother .",anger
"the mother wept; the father in fancy saw him "" famous; "" the town musician was of opinion that he ought not to go to war but should stay at home and learn music .",sadness
the little drummer still kept his healthy color; he had suffered no damage; he looked cheerfully at the dog of the regiment which was jumping along as merrily as if the whole thing had been got up for his amusement and as if the bullets were only flying about that he might have a game of play with them .,joy
now the good god has taken him to himself !,surprise
she folded her hands and hid her face in the cotton curtains of the bed and wept .,sadness
perhaps he ' s in the water in the marsh !,sadness
nobody knows his grave; no holy words have been read over it !,sadness
and the lord ' s prayer went inaudibly over her lips; she bowed her head and was so weary that she went to sleep .,sadness
the dog of the regiment sprang on in front with large bounds and made the way three times as long for himself as it really was .,joy
he was as brown as a wild man and his eyes were bright and his face beamed like sunshine .,joy
and his mother held him in her arms; she kissed his lips his forehead and his red hair .,joy
they laughed and they wept; and peter embraced the old fire drum .,joy
bright day ! fire in the heart ! golden treasure ! skrat ! skr r at ! skr r r r at !,joy
the neighbors declared it was unbearable and the fire drum was of the same opinion .,anger
it seemed too much for him to bear; and this happened not once but many times; and at last one day he seized the delicate fingers and the white hand and kissed it and looked into her great brown eyes .,joy
charlotte blushed to guess at it .,joy
to be famous !,joy
"no ! "" cried peter and he sprang up from his chair .",surprise
she had heard it from the baker ' s wife whose husband had it from the burgomaster ' s own mouth and peter became as pale as death and sat down again .,surprise
"good heaven ! what ' s the matter with you ? "" asked his mother .",surprise
"nothing nothing; only leave me to myself "" he answered but the tears were running down his cheeks .",sadness
"my sweet child my golden treasure ! "" cried the mother and she wept; but the fire drum sang not out loud but inwardly .",sadness
if his father had only lived to see it !,sadness
"he ' s grown famous ! "" said the fire drum and all his native town said the same thing for the drummer ' s son peter with the red hair peter whom they had known as a little boy running about in wooden shoes and then as a drummer playing for the dancers was become famous !",surprise
"and then he looks so splendid ! "" said the young ladies and the old ladies too; and the oldest of all procured an album for famous locks of hair wholly and solely that she might beg a lock of his rich splendid hair that treasure that golden treasure .",joy
and the son came into the poor room of the drummer elegant as a prince happier than a king .,joy
his eyes were as clear and his face was as radiant as sunshine; and he held his mother in his arms and she kissed his mouth and wept as blissfully as any one can weep for joy; and he nodded at every old piece of furniture in the room at the cupboard with the tea cups and at the flower vase .,joy
now i must do it !,joy
and he beat a thundering roll call on the instrument and the drum felt so highly honored that the parchment burst with exultation .,joy
"he has a splendid touch ! "" said the drum .",joy
i ' ve a remembrance of him now that will last .,joy
the elder one who was named care looked rather gloomy; she always goes about to perform her own business in person; for then she knows it is properly done .,sadness
"i must tell you "" said she "" that to day is my birthday; and in honor of it i have been intrusted with a pair of goloshes to introduce amongst mankind .",joy
"no "" replied care; "" you may depend upon it that whoever puts on those goloshes will be very unhappy and bless the moment in which he can get rid of them .",anger
"why this is horrible; how dreadfully dirty it is ! "" said the counsellor; and the whole pavement has vanished and the lamps are all out .",surprise
"what odd figures ! "" thought he; "" they must be returning from some masquerade .",surprise
the counsellor stared with astonishment as he beheld a most strange procession pass before him .,surprise
the astonished counsellor asked what it all meant and who the gentleman might be .,surprise
"good gracious ! "" he exclaimed; "" what in the world has happened to the bishop ? what can he be thinking about ?",surprise
"then he shook his head and said "" it cannot possibly be the bishop himself .",surprise
"pray tell me where the bridge is ! "" said he .",anger
it is shameful that the lamps are not lighted here and it is as muddy as if one were walking in a marsh .,anger
"i don ' t understand your outlandish talk "" he cried at last angrily turning his back upon them .",anger
"what a scandalous condition this place is in "" said he; never certainly had he found his own times so miserable as on this evening .",anger
"dear me what have they been erecting here ? "" he cried as he caught sight of the east gate which in olden times used to stand at the end of east street .",surprise
"either i behold a fata morgana or i must be tipsy "" groaned the counsellor .",surprise
what is the matter with me ?,surprise
"i am certainly all wrong "" said he with a sigh; and yet i only drank one glass of punch .",surprise
but i cannot bear even that and it was very foolish to give us punch and hot salmon; i shall speak about it to our hostess the agent ' s lady .,anger
not a shop to be seen; nothing but old wretched tumble down houses just as if i were at roeskilde or ringstedt .,surprise
oh dear !,surprise
i certainly am very queer .,surprise
the woman stared at him and shook her head .,anger
"is that to day ' s number of the day ? "" he asked quite mechanically as he saw the woman putting by a large piece of paper .",surprise
"that is very old "" said the counsellor becoming quite cheerful at the sight of this antique drawing .",joy
where did you get this singular sheet ?,joy
"modestia is a beautiful virtue "" said the man .",joy
"oh yes "" replied the counsellor; "" i am very fond of reading useful old books and modern ones as well with the exception of every day stories of which we really have more than enough .",joy
"every day stories ? "" asked the bachelor .",surprise
"oh "" replied the man with a smile; "" and yet they are very witty and are much read at court .",joy
"goodness me ! where am i ? "" said he .",surprise
it bewildered him as he thought of it .,surprise
"what is this ? what does it mean ? "" said he; but he was obliged to drink with them for they overpowered the good man with their politeness .",surprise
"one might believe that the country was going back to heathenism "" he observed .",surprise
this is the most terrible moment of my life .,anger
"is it possible that i have been lying here in the street dreaming ? "" said he .",surprise
yes this is east street; how beautifully bright and gay it looks !,joy
it is quite shocking that one glass of punch should have upset me like this .,surprise
he thought of all the terror and anxiety which he had undergone and felt thankful from his heart for the reality and comfort of modern times which with all their errors were far better than those in which he so lately found himself .,joy
"well i declare there lies a pair of goloshes "" said the watchman .",surprise
the riches and the honor came for me; yet still my greatest wealth was poverty : ah help and pity me !,sadness
thou knowest : ah pity me !,sadness
the lieutenant felt this very keenly and therefore leaned his head against the window frame and sighed deeply .,sadness
"the poor watchman in the street "" said he "" is far happier than i am .",sadness
oh how much happier i should be could i change my being and position with him and pass through life with his humble expectations and hopes !,sadness
yes he is indeed happier than i am .,sadness
"that was an ugly dream "" said he "" but droll enough .",surprise
"there goes one ! "" cried he .",surprise
"i am too fat "" he said; "" i thought my head would be the worst but i cannot get my body through that is certain .",surprise
his first feeling was one of anger and then his spirits sank below zero .,anger
"ha "" he cried "" the blood is rushing to my head and i shall go mad .",anger
i believe i am crazy already; oh i wish i were free then all these sensations would pass off .,surprise
he started back quite bewildered with the fright which the goloshes of fortune had caused him .,surprise
"good gracious ! "" he sighed "" i must have a tendency to softening of the brain and here it is so exceedingly hot that the blood is rushing to my head .",surprise
"that is the cause of it all ! "" he exclaimed "" i must do something in time .",surprise
"ho ! "" he cried jumping down and rushing towards the plunging bath .",surprise
what a free happy man you are .,joy
"they are strange people these poets "" thought the clerk .",anger
this is a splendid spring day for a poet the air is so remarkably clear the clouds are so beautiful and the green grass has such a sweet smell .,joy
for many years i have not felt as i do at this moment .,joy
"what a delightful perfume "" said he; "" it reminds me of the violets at aunt lora ' s .",joy
dear me how long it seems since i thought of those days !,surprise
"yes this is my fate "" and he sighed deeply .",sadness
good gracious what has come over me ?,surprise
i never felt before as i do now; it must be the air of spring .,surprise
it is overpowering and yet it is delightful .,joy
what is this ? in my own handwriting too !,surprise
however did i get all this ?,surprise
and here is a letter !,surprise
"as the clerk thought of all these things and became conscious of the great change in his own feelings he smiled and said to himself "" i must be asleep and dreaming; and yet if so how wonderful for a dream to be so natural and real and to know at the same time too that it is but a dream .",joy
"ah ! "" he sighed mournfully as he gazed at the birds singing merrily or hopping from branch to branch "" they are much better off than i . flying is a glorious power .",sadness
he felt what was taking place and laughed to himself .,joy
well now it is evident i must be dreaming; but i never had such a wild dream as this .,surprise
"well "" thought he "" this is charming; by day i sit in a police office amongst the dryest law papers and at night i can dream that i am a lark flying about in the gardens of fredericksburg .",joy
"a sailor boy had flung his large cap over the bird and a hand came underneath and caught the clerk by the back and wings so roughly that he squeaked and then cried out in his alarm "" you impudent rascal i am a clerk in the police office ! "" but it only sounded to the boy like "" tweet tweet; "" so he tapped the bird on the beak and walked away with him .",anger
it is a miserable story indeed especially now i have fallen into the hands of boys .,sadness
the boys carried him into a very elegant room where a stout pleasant looking lady received them but she was not at all gratified to find that they had brought a lark a common field bird as she called it .,anger
"it will please polly perhaps "" she said laughing at a large gray parrot who was swinging himself proudly on a ring in a handsome brass cage .",joy
"you screamer ! "" said the lady throwing a white handkerchief over the cage .",anger
you raise your naturally high notes so much that you get covered over .,anger
they never serve me so .,anger
"ha ! ha ! ha ! "" laughed polly and repeated his witty saying "" now let us be men .",joy
fly out ! they have forgotten to close the cage and the window is open at the top .,surprise
fly fly !,surprise
"heaven preserve us ! "" said he; "" how did i get up here and fall asleep in this way ?",surprise
"oh to travel to travel ! "" cried he; "" there is no greater happiness in the world : it is the height of my ambition .",joy
grand dark and gloomy appeared the landscape around him .,surprise
"ah "" he sighed "" if i were only on the other side of the alps now it would be summer and i should be able to get money on my letter of credit .",sadness
the anxiety i feel on this matter prevents me from enjoying myself in switzerland .,sadness
oh i wish i was on the other side of the alps .,sadness
it was a glorious spectacle; but the stomachs of the travellers were empty their bodies exhausted with fatigue and all the longings of their heart turned towards a resting place for the night; but where to find one they knew not .,sadness
all the eyes were too eagerly seeking for this resting place to notice the beauties of nature .,sadness
"eccellenza miserabili ! "" they exclaimed stretching forth their diseased limbs .",sadness
wherever i go i feel a want which oppresses my heart for something better presents itself at the moment; yes something better which shall be the best of all; but where is that to be found ?,anger
"look ! "" said care; "" what happiness have your goloshes brought to mankind ?",anger
"not so "" said care "" he went away of himself he was not summoned .",anger
she ' s good for nothing .,anger
what a sad thing it is with these people .,anger
tell your mother she ought to be ashamed of herself .,anger
don ' t you become a drunkard but i expect you will though .,anger
poor child ! there go now .,anger
"ah how much good that does and how it warms me "" she said; "" it is as good as a hot meal and not so dear .",joy
oh how cold the water is !,surprise
"i work hard and suffer pain with my poor hands "" said she "" but i do it willingly that i may be able to bring you up honestly and truthfully my dear boy .",sadness
"oh you poor thing; how you do work standing there in the water ! "" she exclaimed .",surprise
and then martha repeated to the laundress in a very few minutes all that the mayor had said to her boy which she had overheard; and she felt very angry that any man could speak as he had done of a mother to her own child about the few drops she had taken; and she was still more angry because on that very day the mayor was going to have a dinner party at which there would be wine strong rich wine drunk by the bottle .,anger
many will take more than they ought but they don ' t call that drinking !,anger
"they are all right you are good for nothing indeed ! "" cried martha indignantly .",anger
"and so he spoke to you in that way did he my child ? "" said the washer woman and her lips trembled as she spoke .",surprise
well perhaps he is right but he should not have said it to my child .,anger
how much has happened to me from that house !,surprise
"dead ! "" cried the laundress turning pale as death .",surprise
"is he dead ? "" she exclaimed .",surprise
"oh he was such a kind good hearted man there are not many like him "" and the tears rolled down her cheeks as she spoke .",sadness
"then she cried "" oh dear me; i feel quite ill : everything is going round me i cannot bear it .",sadness
"dear me you are ill indeed "" said the other woman .",surprise
"the limbs of the laundress shook under her and she said "" i have stood too long in the cold water and i have had nothing to eat the whole day since the morning .",sadness
o kind heaven help me to get home; i am in a burning fever .,sadness
"oh my poor child "" and she burst into tears .",sadness
and he poor boy wept also as he sat alone by the river near to and watching the damp linen .,sadness
"oh it is the laundress "" said he; "" she has had a little drop too much .",anger
she is good for nothing .,anger
it is a sad thing for her pretty little son .,anger
i like the boy very well; but the mother is good for nothing .,anger
the warm beer had strengthened her and the smell of the good food had been pleasant to her .,joy
"many thanks you good soul "" she said to martha .",joy
every word she said pierced my heart like a knife; but i knew she was right and the thought pressed heavily upon me .,sadness
i kissed her hand and wept bitter tears and i wept still more when i went to my room and threw myself on the bed .,sadness
i passed through a dreadful night; god knows what i suffered and how i struggled .,sadness
i went up to him and took his hand and said ' do you still feel the same for me ? ' ' yes; ever and always ' said he .,joy
' will you then marry a maiden who honors and esteems you although she cannot offer you her love ? but that may come . ' ' yes it will come ' said he; and we joined our hands together and i went home to my mistress .,joy
then my mistress threw her arms round me and kissed me .,joy
"ah yes and you were a dear good mistress "" said martha "" i shall never forget how kind you and your husband were to me .",joy
yes those were happy years when you were with us although we had no children at first .,joy
i saw him looking pale as death and deeply troubled standing at her grave; for she was his mother .,sadness
sometime after when his father died he was in foreign lands and did not come home .,sadness
we were backward in our payments we borrowed more money and all that we had was lost and sold and then my husband died .,sadness
since then i have worked toiled and striven for the sake of the child .,sadness
"she has drunk herself to death "" said the cruel mayor .",anger
"there was something between my brother and her i remember "" said the mayor; "" it is a good thing that she is out of the way for now the boy will have the whole .",anger
"the mayor sent for the boy to come to him and promised to take care of him but most cruelly added that it was a good thing that his mother was dead for "" she was good for nothing .",anger
"oh my poor mother ! "" he cried while the tears rolled down his cheeks .",sadness
is it true what they say that she was good for nothing ?,sadness
and then she can tell the most wonderful stories .,joy
she has a hymn book with large silver clasps in which she often reads; and in the book between the leaves lies a rose quite flat and dry; it is not so pretty as the roses which are standing in the glass and yet she smiles at it most pleasantly and tears even come into her eyes .,joy
why when grandmother ' s tears fall upon the rose and she is looking at it the rose revives and fills the room with its fragrance; the walls vanish as in a mist and all around her is the glorious green wood where in summer the sunlight streams through thick foliage; and grandmother why she is young again a charming maiden fresh as a rose with round rosy cheeks fair bright ringlets and a figure pretty and graceful; but the eyes those mild saintly eyes are the same they have been left to grandmother .,joy
at her side sits a young man tall and strong; he gives her a rose and she smiles .,joy
grandmother cannot smile like that now .,sadness
we could hear her gentle breathing as she slept; gradually it became quieter and calmer and on her countenance beamed happiness and peace .,joy
it was as if lighted up with a ray of sunshine .,joy
she smiled once more and then people said she was dead .,joy
she was laid in a black coffin looking mild and beautiful in the white folds of the shrouded linen though her eyes were closed; but every wrinkle had vanished her hair looked white and silvery and around her mouth lingered a sweet smile .,joy
they are better off than we are; the dead return no more .,joy
but over the grave fresh roses bloom the nightingale sings and the organ sounds and there still lives a remembrance of old grandmother with the loving gentle eyes that always looked young .,joy
"we complied and she wrote; but in the midst of the "" general war "" she struck fast sighed deeply and said "" i am only a woman !",surprise
her puggie had seated itself on the ground while she wrote and growled; for the dog had come with her for amusement and for the sake of its health; and then the bare floor ought not to be offered to a visitor .,anger
he is like one of the family faithful and grumpy; but the latter is my grandchildren ' s fault for they have teased him; they play at wedding and want to give him the part of the bridesmaid and that ' s too much for him poor old fellow .,anger
puggie died ! !,surprise
this proposal was adopted by acclamation .,joy
many were noticed to go about on that afternoon with only one suspender; but then they had seen puggie ' s grave and the sight was worth much more .,joy
but in front of the tan yard close to the entrance stood a little girl clothed in rags very pretty to look at with curly hair and eyes so blue and clear that it was a pleasure to look into them .,joy
she had not a button that she knew right well and therefore she remained standing sorrowfully outside till all the others had seen the grave and had gone away; then she sat down held her little brown hands before her eyes and burst into tears; this girl alone had not seen puggie ' s grave .,sadness
it was a grief as great to her as any grown person can experience .,sadness
"the great white snails which grand people in olden times used to have made into fricassees; and when they had eaten them they would say "" o what a delicious dish ! "" for these people really thought them good; and these snails lived on burdock leaves and for them the burdock was planted .",joy
they lived quite retired and very happily; and as they had no children of their own they had adopted a little common snail which they brought up as their own child .,joy
"listen what a drumming there is on the burdock leaves; turn turn turn; turn turn turn "" said the father snail .",surprise
"there come the drops "" said the mother; "" they are trickling down the stalks .",joy
we shall have it very wet here presently .,joy
i am very glad we have such good houses and that the little one has one of his own .,joy
there has been really more done for us than for any other creature; it is quite plain that we are the most noble people in the world .,joy
"there can be nothing better than we have here "" said the father snail; "" i wish for nothing more .",joy
you need not be in a hurry; you are always so impatient and the youngster is getting just the same .,anger
i feel quite giddy when i look at him .,joy
he will be the joy of our home; and we old folks have nothing else to live for .,joy
"there may be black snails no doubt "" said the old snail; "" black snails without houses; but they are so vulgar and conceited too .",anger
"she has a palace "" replied the ant "" a most beautiful ant palace with seven hundred passages .",joy
"thank you "" said the mother snail; "" but our boy shall not go to live in an ant hill .",joy
he has the whole burdock forest; she has only a bush .,anger
but a beautiful speech was made by the mother snail .,joy
the father could not speak; he was too much overcome .,joy
then they gave the whole burdock forest to the young snails as an inheritance and repeated what they had so often said that it was the finest place in the world and that if they led upright and honorable lives and their family increased they and their children might some day be taken to the nobleman ' s palace to be boiled black and laid on a silver dish .,joy
and the rain fell upon the burdock leaves to play the drum for them and the sun shone to paint colors on the burdock forest for them and they were very happy; the whole family were entirely and perfectly happy .,joy
"what a ridiculous little shoot ! "" said one .",surprise
"it must be a kind of garden plant "" said another; and so they sneered and despised the plant as a thing from a garden .",anger
it is stupid nonsense to allow yourself to shoot out in this way; we are not here to support you .,anger
when spring came the plant appeared in full bloom : a more beautiful object than any other plant in the forest .,surprise
"it must be some degenerate species "" said he; "" i do not know it and it is not mentioned in any system .",surprise
"not known in any system ! "" repeated the thistles and the nettles .",anger
they imagined evil in their hearts but god turned it to good .,joy
the girl stood still before the wonderful plant for the green leaves exhaled a sweet and refreshing fragrance and the flowers glittered and sparkled in the sunshine like colored flames and the harmony of sweet sounds lingered round them as if each concealed within itself a deep fount of melody which thousands of years could not exhaust .,joy
with pious gratitude the girl looked upon this glorious work of god and bent down over one of the branches that she might examine the flower and inhale the sweet perfume .,joy
then a light broke in on her mind and her heart expanded .,joy
she knew it would so soon fade; so she took only a single green leaf carried it home and laid it in her bible where it remained ever green fresh and unfading .,surprise
between the pages of the bible it still lay when a few weeks afterwards that bible was laid under the young girl ' s head in her coffin .,surprise
in the forest the wonderful plant still continued to bloom till it grew and became almost a tree and all the birds of passage bowed themselves before it .,joy
"that plant is a foreigner no doubt "" said the thistles and the burdocks .",anger
we can never conduct ourselves like that in this country .,anger
and the black forest snails actually spat at the flower .,anger
he pulled up the wonderful plant roots and all and placed it in his bundle .,surprise
not long after the king of the country suffered from the deepest melancholy .,sadness
they read deep and learned books to him and then the lightest and most trifling that could be found but all to no purpose .,sadness
you did not know any better !,surprise
ignorance upon ignorance indeed !,anger
the poor swineherd took these words to heart for they were addressed to him; he knew not that there were others who were equally ignorant .,sadness
then the king in his melancholy wandered out to the spot in the wood .,sadness
the botanical professor wrote a long treatise about the heavenly plant and for this he was loaded with gold which improved the position of himself and his family .,joy
for the plant had disappeared and the king remained as melancholy and sad as ever but the sentry said he had always been so .,sadness
and the old grandfather nodded again; and the more he looked at holger danske the more satisfied he felt that he had carved a good image of him .,joy
"that is the most beautiful coat of arms in the world "" said the old man .",joy
and the third flame led him to greenland ' s wretched huts where the preacher hans egede ruled with love in every word and action .,joy
the old grandfather wiped his eyes for he had known king frederick with his silvery locks and his honest blue eyes and had lived for him and he folded his hands and remained for some time silent .,sadness
"what you have been carving is very beautiful grandfather "" said she .",surprise
i was on board the denmark in steene bille ' s squadron; i had a man by my side whom even the cannon balls seemed to fear .,joy
he sung old songs in a merry voice and fired and fought as if he were something more than a man .,joy
i still remember his face but from whence he came or whither he went i know not; no one knows .,sadness
then the daughter in law kissed the old grandfather and led him to a large arm chair by the table; and she and her husband who was the son of the old man and the father of the little boy who lay in bed sat down to supper with him .,joy
holger danske can appear in marble so that people in all countries of the world may hear of the strength of denmark .,joy
now let us drink the health of bertel .,joy
"and holger danske did dream of the little humble room in which the image carver sat; he heard all that had been said and he nodded in his dream saying "" ah yes remember me you danish people keep me in your memory i will come to you in the hour of need .",joy
but one day ib succeeded so well in his carving that he made two pieces of wood look really like two little wooden shoes and he determined to give them as a present to little christina .,surprise
ib and christina agreed together in everything; they divided their bread and berries when they were hungry; they were partners in digging their little gardens; they ran and crept and played about everywhere .,joy
they floated on swiftly for the tide was in their favor passing over lakes formed by the stream in its course; sometimes they seemed quite enclosed by reeds and water plants yet there was always room for them to pass out although the old trees overhung the water and the old oaks stretched out their bare branches as if they had turned up their sleeves and wished to show their knotty naked arms .,joy
the water lilies waved themselves to and fro on the river everything made the excursion beautiful and at last they came to the great eel weir where the water rushed through the flood gates; and the children thought this a beautiful sight .,joy
first they peeped into the basket containing the eels and the sucking pig; then they must needs pull out the pig and take it in their hands and feel it and touch it; and as they both wanted to hold it at the same time the consequence was that they let it fall into the water and the pig sailed away with the stream .,surprise
here was a terrible disaster .,surprise
in a few minutes they found themselves deep in a thicket and could no longer see the boat or the shore .,surprise
they ran on a little farther and then christina fell down and began to cry .,sadness
they looked so inviting that the children could not help stopping; and they remained there so long eating that their mouths and cheeks became quite black with the juice .,joy
at last they both lost themselves in the thicket; christina began to cry and then ib cried too; and after weeping and lamenting for some time they stretched themselves down on the dry leaves and fell asleep .,sadness
great quantities of fish could be seen through the clear water sparkling in the sun ' s rays; they were quite surprised when they came so suddenly upon such an unexpected sight .,surprise
out of the thicket stepped a tall old woman her face quite brown and her hair of a deep shining black; the whites of her eyes glittered like a moor ' s; on her back she carried a bundle and in her hand a knotted stick .,surprise
she drew out of her pocket three large nuts in which she told them were hidden the most beautiful and lovely things in the world for they were wishing nuts .,surprise
ib looked at her and as she spoke so kindly he took courage and asked her if she would give him the nuts; and the woman gave them to him and then gathered some more from the bushes for herself quite a pocket full .,joy
ib and christina looked at the wishing nuts with wide open eyes .,joy
"there are ten neckerchiefs in it "" she replied "" as well as beautiful dresses stockings and a hat and veil .",surprise
"then i will have that one also "" said christina; "" and it is a pretty one too .",joy
"the best of all things for you "" replied the gypsy .",joy
in the wild wood path they met a forester who knew ib and by his help ib and christina reached home where they found every one had been very anxious about them .,joy
but there was not much kernel to be seen; it was what we should call hollow or worm eaten and looked as if it had been filled with tobacco or rich black earth .,surprise
"it is just what i expected ! "" exclaimed ib .",surprise
how should there be room in a little nut like this for the best thing of all ?,anger
one day in the following spring there came a knock at the door of the house where ib ' s old mother lived; and when they opened it lo and behold in stepped the boatman and christina .,surprise
he could not utter a word; he could only seize her hand and hold it fast in his own but he felt too happy and glad to open his lips .,joy
christina however was quite at her ease; she talked and talked and kissed him in the most friendly manner .,joy
"even afterwards when they were left alone and she asked "" did you know me again ib ? "" he still stood holding her hand and said at last "" you are become quite a grand lady christina and i am only a rough working man; but i have often thought of you and of old times .",joy
"his eyes brightened and the words he uttered came with hesitation from his lips but from the deepest recesses of his heart : "" christina if you have not become too grand and if you can be contented to live in my mother ' s house as my wife we will be married some day .",joy
"oh yes "" she replied; "" let us wait a little longer ib .",joy
i can trust you for i believe that i do love you .,joy
but let me think it over .,surprise
then he kissed her lips; and so they parted .,joy
she was courted and admired by every one; but her master ' s son who had been home on a visit was so much pleased with christina that he wished to marry her .,surprise
"at first ib said not a word but he became as white as the wall and shook his head gently and then he spoke "" christina must not refuse this good fortune .",sadness
ib sat down to write but he could not get on at all .,sadness
very little was said about the matter to ib and he did not refer to it; his mother however noticed that he had grown very silent and pensive .,sadness
he understood the gypsy woman ' s meaning now .,joy
during the two long years which followed no letter came from christina to her father; and when at last her father received one from her it did not speak of prosperity or happiness .,surprise
poor christina !,sadness
he searched and found a large golden armlet of superior workmanship and it was evident that the plough had disturbed a hun ' s grave .,surprise
he searched further and found more valuable treasures which ib showed to the clergyman who explained their value to him .,surprise
"you have found in the earth the best thing you could find "" said the magistrate .",joy
"the best thing "" thought ib; "" the very best thing for me and found in the earth !",surprise
well if it really is so then the gypsy woman was right in her prophecy .,joy
at last a very little girl came out of one of the wretched looking houses and ib asked her to tell him the way to the street he wanted; she looked up timidly at him and began to cry bitterly .,sadness
a strange sensation came over ib as he caught sight of it .,surprise
the living breathing embodiment of little christina stood before him just as he remembered her in the days of her childhood .,surprise
the air in the room was heavy and stifling no light was burning and from one corner came sounds of moaning and sighing .,sadness
he started as he did so .,surprise
it was christina of the heath !,surprise
the cold hand of death had already touched the heart of christina .,sadness
her youngest child looked for in the midst of prosperity had sunk into the grave when only a few weeks old; and at last christina herself became sick unto death and lay forsaken and dying in a miserable room amid poverty she might have borne in her younger days but which was now more painful to her from the luxuries to which she had lately been accustomed .,sadness
"it makes me unhappy to think that i shall die and leave this poor child "" sighed she .",sadness
oh what will become of her ?,sadness
he never knew; for not another word escaped her lips .,sadness
all was life and joy .,joy
ib ' s house was well and prettily furnished; for he was a prosperous man now while the mother of the little girl rested in the churchyard at copenhagen where she had died in poverty .,joy
this person moreover maintained that he belonged to a very old family in the land of egypt and that he was highly esteemed there .,joy
"i sing so "" he said "" that sixteen native crickets who have chirped from their youth up and have never yet had a card house of their own would become thinner than they are with envy if they were to hear me .",joy
that was very mean .,surprise
the grasshopper only sprang half as high but he sprang straight into the king ' s face and the king declared that was horribly rude .,anger
"i jumped highest after all "" said the flea .",anger
let her have the goose bone with its lump of wax and bit of stick .,anger
i jumped to the highest; but in this world a body is required if one wishes to be seen .,anger
"and he too said "" body is required ! body is required !",anger
and then he sang his own melancholy song and from that we have gathered this story which they say is not true though it ' s in print .,sadness
"on many a warm summer the ephemera the flies that exist for only a day had fluttered about the old oak enjoyed life and felt happy and if for a moment one of the tiny creatures rested on one of his large fresh leaves the tree would always say "" poor little creature ! your whole life consists only of a single day .",joy
"melancholy ! what do you mean ? "" the little creature would always reply .",surprise
everything around me is so wonderfully bright and warm and beautiful that it makes me joyous .,joy
"over ! "" repeated the fly; "" what is the meaning of all over ?",surprise
you may have thousands of my days but i have thousands of moments in which i can be merry and happy .,joy
and the little creature danced and floated in the air rejoicing in her delicate wings of gauze and velvet rejoicing in the balmy breezes laden with the fragrance of clover fields and wild roses elder blossoms and honeysuckle from the garden hedges wild thyme primroses and mint and the scent of all these was so strong that the perfume almost intoxicated the little fly .,joy
the long and beautiful day had been so full of joy and sweet delights that when the sun sank low it felt tired of all its happiness and enjoyment .,joy
its wings could sustain it no longer and gently and slowly it glided down upon the soft waving blades of grass nodded its little head as well as it could nod and slept peacefully and sweetly .,joy
"poor little ephemera ! "" said the oak; "" what a terribly short life !",sadness
the same thing was continued through many generations of ephemera; all of them felt equally merry and equally happy .,joy
crows and rooks came by turns and sat on them and talked of the hard times which were beginning and how difficult it was in winter to obtain food .,sadness
the tree had doubtless a kind of feeling that the festive time had arrived and in his dream fancied he heard the bells ringing from all the churches round and yet it seemed to him to be a beautiful summer ' s day mild and warm .,joy
his mighty summits was crowned with spreading fresh green foliage; the sunbeams played among the leaves and branches and the air was full of fragrance from herb and blossom; painted butterflies chased each other; the summer flies danced around him as if the world had been created merely for them to dance and be merry in .,joy
he saw lovers meet in quiet happiness near him in the moonshine and carve the initials of their names in the grayish green bark on his trunk .,joy
once but long years had intervened since then guitars and eolian harps had been hung on his boughs by merry travellers; now they seemed to hang there again and he could hear their marvellous tones .,joy
then it seemed as if new life was thrilling through every fibre of root and stem and leaf rising even to the highest branches .,joy
the tree felt itself stretching and spreading out while through the root beneath the earth ran the warm vigor of life .,joy
as he grew higher and still higher with increased strength his topmost boughs became broader and fuller; and in proportion to his growth so was his self satisfaction increased and with it arose a joyous longing to grow higher and higher to reach even to the warm bright sun itself .,joy
these were wonderful and happy moments for the old tree full of peace and joy; and yet amidst all this happiness the tree felt a yearning longing desire that all the other trees bushes herbs and flowers beneath him might be able also to rise higher as he had done and to see all this splendor and experience the same happiness .,sadness
the grand majestic oak could not be quite happy in the midst of his enjoyment while all the rest both great and small were not with him .,sadness
and this feeling of yearning trembled through every branch through every leaf as warmly and fervently as if they had been the fibres of a human heart .,sadness
at length his longing was satisfied .,joy
up through the clouds came the green summits of the forest trees and beneath him the oak saw them rising and growing higher and higher .,surprise
may beetles hummed the bees murmured the birds sang each in his own way; the air was filled with the sounds of song and gladness .,joy
"why this is beautiful too beautiful to be believed "" said the oak in a joyful tone .",joy
i have them all here both great and small; not one has been forgotten .,joy
can such happiness be imagined ?,joy
"it is right so it is best "" said the tree "" no fetters hold me now .",joy
i can fly up to the very highest point in light and glory .,joy
and all i love are with me both small and great .,joy
all all are here .,joy
the root was torn from the ground just at the moment when in his dream he fancied it was being loosened from the earth .,surprise
he fell his three hundred and sixty five years were passed as the single day of the ephemera .,surprise
the sea gradually became calm and on board a great ship that had withstood the tempest during the night all the flags were displayed as a token of joy and festivity .,joy
the tree is down !,surprise
"the old oak our landmark on the coast ! "" exclaimed the sailors .",surprise
it must have fallen in the storm of last night .,surprise
who can replace it ?,sadness
alas ! no one .,sadness
thus sounded the old christmas carol and every one on board the ship felt his thoughts elevated through the song and the prayer even as the old tree had felt lifted up in its last its beautiful dream on that christmas morn .,joy
we are in a rich happy house where the master the servants the friends of the family are full of joy and felicity .,joy
for on this day a son and heir has been born and mother and child are doing well .,joy
everything invited to slumber everything had a charming look of repose; and so the nurse had discovered for she slept; and well she might sleep while everything around her told of happiness and blessing .,joy
"everything has been bestowed here "" said the guardian angel .",joy
"wanting ! "" cried the guardian angel; "" nothing must be wanting here; and if it is so let us fetch it; let us seek the powerful fairy; let us go to her .",anger
her pearl must not be missing; it must be there that the crown when worn may be complete .,anger
tears of sorrow rolled down their cheeks and fell in heavy drops on the floor but not a word was spoken .,sadness
the silence which reigned here expressed a world of grief .,sadness
with silent steps still sobbing they left the room .,sadness
strange men came in and placed the lid of the coffin over the dead and drove the nails firmly in; while the blows of the hammer resounded through the house and echoed in the hearts that were bleeding .,sadness
a hot tear rolled into her lap and formed itself into a pearl glowing with all the colors of the rainbow .,sadness
"they looked at little claus ploughing with his five horses and he was so proud that he smacked his whip and said "" gee up my five horses .",joy
"you must not say that "" said big claus; "" for only one of them belongs to you .",anger
"now i must beg you not to say that again "" said big claus; "" for if you do i shall hit your horse on the head so that he will drop dead on the spot and there will be an end of him .",anger
"i promise you i will not say it any more "" said the other; but as soon as people came by nodding to him and wishing him "" good day "" he became so pleased and thought how grand it looked to have five horses ploughing in his field that he cried out again "" gee up all my horses !",joy
"i ' ll gee up your horses for you "" said big claus; and seizing a hammer he struck the one horse of little claus on the head and he fell dead instantly .",surprise
oh now i have no horse at all said little claus weeping .,sadness
"then i shall be obliged to lie out here "" said little claus to himself as the farmer ' s wife shut the door in his face .",sadness
the farmer ' s wife and the sexton were sitting at the table together; and she filled his glass and helped him plenteously to fish which appeared to be his favorite dish .,joy
"oh dear "" sighed little claus from the top of the shed as he saw all the good things disappear .",sadness
"is any one up there ? "" asked the farmer looking up and discovering little claus .",surprise
why are you lying up there ?,surprise
the woman received them both very kindly laid the cloth on a large table and placed before them a dish of porridge .,joy
now little claus did not relish the porridge at all so he trod with his foot on the sack under the table and the dry skin squeaked quite loud .,sadness
"hallo ! what have you got in your sack ! "" asked the farmer .",surprise
"wonderful ! "" cried the farmer starting up and opening the oven door; and there lay all the nice things hidden by the farmer ' s wife but which he supposed had been conjured there by the wizard under the table .",surprise
so the woman was obliged to bring out the wine also which she had hidden and the farmer drank it till he became quite merry .,joy
i should like to see him now while i am so merry .,joy
oh i am not afraid .,joy
"oh "" cried he springing backwards "" i saw him and he is exactly like our sexton .",surprise
how dreadful it is !,surprise
i would not have it in the house another hour; there is no knowing if he may not be still there .,anger
"i have been well paid for my horse "" said he to himself when he reached home entered his own room and emptied all his money into a heap on the floor .",joy
"what can he want it for ? "" thought great claus; so he smeared the bottom of the measure with tar that some of whatever was put into it might stick there and remain .",anger
"are you mad ? "" they all cried; "" do you think we have money to spend by the bushel ?",surprise
"he is making fools of us "" said they all; then the shoemakers took their straps and the tanners their leather aprons and began to beat great claus .",anger
"skins skins ! "" they cried mocking him; "" yes we ' ll mark your skin for you till it is black and blue .",anger
"out of the town with him "" said they .",anger
"ah "" said he as he came to his house; "" little claus shall pay me for this; i will beat him to death .",anger
she had been cross unkind and really spiteful to him; but he was very sorry and took the dead woman and laid her in his warm bed to see if he could bring her to life again .,sadness
"there "" cried he "" now you cannot make a fool of me again; "" and then he went home .",anger
"that is a very wicked man "" thought little claus; "" he meant to kill me .",surprise
the landlord was a rich man and a good man too; but as passionate as if he had been made of pepper and snuff .,anger
again and again he bawled it out but as she did not stir he flew into a passion and threw the glass of mead in her face; it struck her on the nose and she fell backwards out of the cart for she was only seated there not tied in .,anger
"hallo ! "" cried little claus rushing out of the door and seizing hold of the landlord by the throat; "" you have killed my grandmother; see here is a great hole in her forehead .",surprise
"oh how unfortunate "" said the landlord wringing his hands .",surprise
this all comes of my fiery temper .,anger
"how is this ? "" thought great claus; "" did i not kill him ?",surprise
"how did you get all this money ? "" asked great claus staring with wide open eyes at his neighbor ' s treasures .",surprise
"heaven preserve us ! "" cried the apothecary "" you are out of your mind .",surprise
don ' t say such things or you will lose your head .,anger
and then he talked to him seriously about the wicked deed he had done and told him that such a wicked man would surely be punished .,anger
"you shall pay for this "" said great claus as soon as he got into the highroad "" that you shall little claus .",anger
"you have played me another trick "" said he .",anger
first i killed all my horses and then my old grandmother and it is all your fault; but you shall not make a fool of me any more .,anger
"so he laid hold of little claus round the body and pushed him into the sack which he took on his shoulders saying "" now i ' m going to drown you in the river .",anger
"and i poor fellow "" said the drover "" i who am so old already cannot get there .",sadness
"with all my heart "" replied the drover opening the sack from which sprung little claus as quickly as possible .",joy
"how light he seems now "" said he .",surprise
ah it is because i have been to a church .,joy
"there you may lie ! "" he exclaimed; "" you will play me no more tricks now .",joy
"how is this ? "" said great claus .",surprise
did i not drown you just now ?,surprise
i ' ll tell you the whole story and thank you for drowning me; i am above you now i am really very rich .,joy
"what a lucky fellow you are ! "" exclaimed great claus .",surprise
however if you will go there first and then creep into a sack i will throw you in with the greatest pleasure .,joy
"thank you "" said great claus; "" but remember if i do not get any sea cattle down there i shall come up again and give you a good thrashing .",joy
at the same time the kind hearted old man who lived by himself in the upper storey of the house came in; he led a lonely life for he had no wife and children; but he loved the children of others very much and he could tell so many fairy tales and stories that it was a pleasure to hear him .,joy
"yes if i only knew a fresh one "" said the old man and nodded smilingly .",joy
i ought to tell you a story but the worst of it is i do not know any more .,sadness
that is all very well but such tales or stories are worth nothing !,anger
"will not one knock soon ? "" asked the boy; and the mother smiled while she put elder tree blossoms into the teapot and poured boiling water over them .",joy
"yes if stories came by themselves; they are so proud they only come when they please . but wait "" he said suddenly "" there is one .",surprise
in the midst of the tree sat a kindly looking old woman with a strange dress; it was as green as the leaves and trimmed with large white blossoms so that it was difficult to say whether it was real cloth or the leaves and blossoms of the elder tree .,surprise
he was an old old sailor and she his old wife; they had already great grandchildren and were soon to celebrate their golden wedding but they could not remember the date and the elder tree mother was sitting in the tree and looked as pleased as this one here .,joy
' but first we went to school to learn something ' she said ' and then we were confirmed; we both wept on that day but in the afternoon we went out hand in hand and ascended the high round tower and looked out into the wide world right over copenhagen and the sea; then we walked to fredericksburg where the king and the queen were sailing about in their magnificent boat on the canals . ',sadness
' and i often cried about you for i was afraid lest you were drowned and lying at the bottom of the sea .,sadness
i tore it open and read it; i cried and laughed at the same time and was so happy !,joy
"then suddenly some one put his arm round my waist ' "" ' yes and you gave him a hearty smack on the cheek ' said the old man .",joy
' i did not know that it was you you had come as quickly as your letter; and you looked so handsome and so you do still .,joy
you looked so well and the weather in the street was horrible ! ',joy
' then we married ' he said .,joy
' do you remember how we got our first boy and then mary niels peter john and christian ? ' ' oh yes; and now they have all grown up and have become useful members of society whom everybody cares for . ',joy
' and their children have had children again ' said the old sailor .,joy
' yes to day is your golden wedding day ' said the little elder tree mother stretching her head down between the two old people who thought that she was their neighbour who was nodding to them; they looked at each other and clasped hands .,joy
the elder tree smelt strongly and the setting sun illuminated the faces of the two old people so that they looked quite rosy; the youngest of the grandchildren danced round them and cried merrily that there would be a feast in the evening for they were to have hot potatoes; and the elder mother nodded in the tree and cried ' hooray ' with the others .,joy
and then she took the little boy out of bed and placed him on her bosom; the elder branches full of blossoms closed over them; it was as if they sat in a thick leafy bower which flew with them through the air; it was beautiful beyond all description .,joy
she and the boy kissed each other and then they were of the same age and felt the same joys .,joy
"hooray ! now we shall ride far away many miles ! "" said the boy; "" we shall ride to the nobleman ' s estate where we were last year .",joy
"it was spring and it became summer it was autumn and it became winter and thousands of pictures reflected themselves in the boy ' s eyes and heart and the little girl always sang again "" you will never forget that !",joy
oh ! that it were always spring in the fragrant beechwood !,joy
"here it is splendid in summer ! "" she said and they passed by old castles of the age of chivalry .",joy
one can never forget it !,joy
"here it ' s agreeable in winter ! "" said the little girl and all the trees were covered with hoar frost so that they looked like white coral .",joy
and indeed it was beautiful !,joy
"the little girl with the blue eyes and elder blossoms in her hair was sitting high up in the tree and nodded to them saying "" to day is the golden wedding !",joy
and then she took two flowers out of her wreath and kissed them .,joy
the little boy in bed did not know whether he had dreamt it or heard it told; the teapot stood on the table but no elder tree was growing out of it and the old man who had told the story was on the point of leaving the room and he did go out .,surprise
"how beautiful it was ! "" said the little boy .",joy
mother i have been to warm countries !,joy
"i believe you "" said the mother; "" if one takes two cups of hot elder tea it is quite natural that one gets into warm countries !",joy
"my poor flowers are quite dead "" said little ida "" they were so pretty yesterday evening and now all the leaves are hanging down quite withered .",sadness
"what do they do that for "" she asked of the student who sat on the sofa; she liked him very much he could tell the most amusing stories and cut out the prettiest pictures; hearts and ladies dancing castles with doors that opened as well as flowers; he was a delightful student .",joy
"why do the flowers look so faded to day ? "" she asked again and pointed to her nosegay which was quite withered .",anger
when it grows dark and everybody is asleep they jump about quite merrily .,joy
you must know that as soon as the king and all the court are gone into the town the flowers run out of the garden into the castle and you should see how merry they are .,joy
then the old steward says ' i smell flowers here ' but he cannot see them .,anger
"oh how capital "" said little ida clapping her hands .",joy
i will tell you what to do and the botanical professor who lives close by here will be so surprised .,surprise
how he will wonder what has become of them !,joy
it was saying ' you are so pretty i like you very much . ',joy
but the professor did not approve of such nonsense so he clapped his hands on the nettle to stop it .,anger
then the leaves which are its fingers stung him so sharply that he has never ventured to touch a nettle since .,anger
"oh how funny ! "" said ida and she laughed .",joy
"how can anyone put such notions into a child ' s head ? "" said a tiresome lawyer who had come to pay a visit and sat on the sofa .",anger
he did not like the student and would grumble when he saw him cutting out droll or amusing pictures .,anger
"but the lawyer did not like such jokes and he would say as he had just said "" how can anyone put such nonsense into a child ' s head ! what absurd fancies there are !",anger
but to little ida all these stories which the student told her about the flowers seemed very droll and she thought over them a great deal .,joy
so she took the doll out who looked quite cross and said not a single word for she was angry at being turned out of her bed .,anger
"then she whispered to them quite softly "" i know you are going to a ball to night .",joy
but the flowers appeared as if they did not understand and not a leaf moved; still ida felt quite sure she knew all about it .,joy
she lay awake a long time after she was in bed thinking how pretty it must be to see all the beautiful flowers dancing in the king ' s garden .,joy
she raised herself a little and glanced at the door of the room where all her flowers and playthings lay; it was partly open and as she listened it seemed as if some one in the room was playing the piano but softly and more prettily than she had ever before heard it .,joy
"now all the flowers are certainly dancing in there "" she thought "" oh how much i should like to see them "" but she did not dare move for fear of disturbing her father and mother .",joy
oh what a splendid sight there was to be sure !,joy
the flowers were dancing gracefully on the floor making turns and holding each other by their long green leaves as they swung round .,joy
then she saw a large purple crocus jump into the middle of the table where the playthings stood go up to the doll ' s bedstead and draw back the curtains; there lay the sick flowers but they got up directly and nodded to the others as a sign that they wished to dance with them .,joy
they did not look ill at all now but jumped about and were very merry yet none of them noticed little ida .,joy
the carnival rod hopped about among the flowers on its three red stilted feet and stamped quite loud when it danced the mazurka; the flowers could not perform this dance they were too light to stamp in that manner .,joy
"all at once the wax doll which rode on the carnival rod seemed to grow larger and taller and it turned round and said to the paper flowers "" how can you put such things in a child ' s head ? they are all foolish fancies; "" and then the doll was exactly like the lawyer with the broad brimmed hat and looked as yellow and as cross as he did; but the paper dolls struck him on his thin legs and he shrunk up again and became quite a little wax doll .",anger
this was very amusing and ida could not help laughing .,joy
"then sophy raised himself and looked round quite astonished "" there must be a ball here to night "" said sophy .",surprise
why did not somebody tell me ?,anger
"will you dance with me ? "" said the rough doll .",joy
"you are the right sort to dance with certainly "" said she turning her back upon him .",anger
all the flowers came round her directly and asked if she had hurt herself especially those who had lain in her bed .,surprise
but she was not hurt at all and ida ' s flowers thanked her for the use of the nice bed and were very kind to her .,joy
then sophy was very happy and said they might keep her bed; she did not mind lying in the drawer at all .,joy
"but the flowers thanked her very much and said "" we cannot live long .",joy
to morrow morning we shall be quite dead; and you must tell little ida to bury us in the garden near to the grave of the canary; then in the summer we shall wake up and be more beautiful than ever .,sadness
"no you must not die "" said sophy as she kissed the flowers .",sadness
then came many more flowers : blue violets purple heart ' s ease daisies and lilies of the valley and they all danced together and kissed each other .,joy
"you are not kind at all "" said ida; "" and yet they all danced with you .",anger
ida kissed her flowers and then laid them with the box in the earth .,joy
in the cold and the darkness a poor little girl with bare head and naked feet roamed through the streets .,sadness
no one had bought anything of her the whole day nor had any one given here even a penny .,sadness
shivering with cold and hunger she crept along; poor little child she looked the picture of misery .,sadness
in a corner between two houses one of which projected beyond the other she sank down and huddled herself together .,sadness
it was really a wonderful light .,joy
it seemed to the little girl that she was sitting by a large iron stove with polished brass feet and a brass ornament .,joy
how the fire burned ! and seemed so beautifully warm that the child stretched out her feet as if to warm them when lo ! the flame of the match went out the stove vanished and she had only the remains of the half burnt match in her hand .,surprise
then the match went out and there remained nothing but the thick damp cold wall before her .,sadness
she lighted another match and then she found herself sitting under a beautiful christmas tree .,joy
the little one stretched out her hand towards them and the match went out .,surprise
"some one is dying "" thought the little girl for her old grandmother the only one who had ever loved her and who was now dead had told her that when a star falls a soul was going up to god .",sadness
she again rubbed a match on the wall and the light shone round her; in the brightness stood her old grandmother clear and shining yet mild and loving in her appearance .,joy
"grandmother "" cried the little one "" o take me with you; i know you will go away when the match burns out; you will vanish like the warm stove the roast goose and the large glorious christmas tree .",sadness
and the matches glowed with a light that was brighter than the noon day and her grandmother had never appeared so large or so beautiful .,joy
she took the little girl in her arms and they both flew upwards in brightness and joy far above the earth where there was neither cold nor hunger nor pain for they were with god .,joy
in the dawn of morning there lay the poor little one with pale cheeks and smiling mouth leaning against the wall; she had been frozen to death on the last evening of the year; and the new year ' s sun rose and shone upon a little corpse !,surprise
"oh that can be easily managed "" said the fairy .",joy
"thank you "" said the woman and she gave the fairy twelve shillings which was the price of the barleycorn .",joy
"it is a beautiful flower "" said the woman and she kissed the red and golden colored leaves and while she did so the flower opened and she could see that it was a real tulip .",joy
here she slept at night but during the day she amused herself on a table where the woman had placed a plateful of water .,joy
one night while she lay in her pretty bed a large ugly wet toad crept through a broken pane of glass in the window and leaped right upon the table where tiny lay sleeping under her rose leaf quilt .,surprise
what a pretty little wife this would make for my son said the toad and she took up the walnut shell in which little tiny lay asleep and jumped through the window with it into the garden .,surprise
the tiny little creature woke very early in the morning and began to cry bitterly when she found where she was for she could see nothing but water on every side of the large green leaf and no way of reaching the land .,sadness
"the old toad bowed low to her in the water and said "" here is my son he will be your husband and you will live happily in the marsh by the stream .",joy
"croak croak croak "" was all her son could say for himself; so the toad took up the elegant little bed and swam away with it leaving tiny all alone on the green leaf where she sat and wept .",sadness
she could not bear to think of living with the old toad and having her ugly son for a husband .,sadness
as soon as they caught sight of her they saw she was very pretty and it made them very sorry to think that she must go and live with the ugly toads .,sadness
"no it must never be ! "" so they assembled together in the water round the green stalk which held the leaf on which the little maiden stood and gnawed it away at the root with their teeth .",sadness
tiny pleased him and she was glad of it for now the toad could not possibly reach her and the country through which she sailed was beautiful and the sun shone upon the water till it glittered like liquid gold .,joy
presently a large cockchafer flew by; the moment he caught sight of her he seized her round her delicate waist with his claws and flew with her into a tree .,surprise
but especially was she sorry for the beautiful white butterfly which she had fastened to the leaf for if he could not free himself he would die of hunger .,sadness
"after a time all the cockchafers turned up their feelers and said "" she has only two legs ! how ugly that looks .",surprise
"she has no feelers "" said another .",anger
her waist is quite slim .,anger
pooh ! she is like a human being .,anger
"oh ! she is ugly "" said all the lady cockchafers although tiny was very pretty .",anger
then the cockchafer who had run away with her believed all the others when they said she was ugly and would have nothing more to say to her and told her she might go where she liked .,anger
then he flew down with her from the tree and placed her on a daisy and she wept at the thought that she was so ugly that even the cockchafers would have nothing to say to her .,sadness
during the whole summer poor little tiny lived quite alone in the wide forest .,sadness
she felt dreadfully cold for her clothes were torn and she was herself so frail and delicate that poor little tiny was nearly frozen to death .,sadness
then she wrapped herself up in a dry leaf but it cracked in the middle and could not keep her warm and she shivered with cold .,sadness
oh ! how she shivered with the cold .,sadness
there dwelt the field mouse in warmth and comfort with a whole roomful of corn a kitchen and a beautiful dining room .,joy
poor little tiny stood before the door just like a little beggar girl and begged for a small piece of barley corn for she had been without a morsel to eat for two days .,sadness
"you poor little creature "" said the field mouse who was really a good old field mouse "" come into my warm room and dine with me .",sadness
"she was very pleased with tiny so she said "" you are quite welcome to stay with me all the winter if you like; but you must keep my rooms clean and neat and tell me stories for i shall like to hear them very much .",joy
and tiny did all the field mouse asked her and found herself very comfortable .,joy
but tiny did not feel at all interested about this neighbor for he was a mole .,anger
and the mole fell in love with her because she had such a sweet voice; but he said nothing yet for he was very cautious .,joy
in the middle of the floor lay a dead swallow his beautiful wings pulled close to his sides his feet and his head drawn up under his feathers; the poor bird had evidently died of the cold .,sadness
it made little tiny very sad to see it she did so love the little birds; all the summer they had sung and twittered for her so beautifully .,sadness
"perhaps this was the one who sang to me so sweetly in the summer "" she said; "" and how much pleasure it gave me you dear pretty bird .",joy
"farewell you pretty little bird "" said she "" farewell; thank you for your delightful singing during the summer when all the trees were green and the warm sun shone upon us .",sadness
"then she laid her head on the bird ' s breast but she was alarmed immediately for it seemed as if something inside the bird went "" thump thump .",surprise
it was the bird ' s heart; he was not really dead only benumbed with the cold and the warmth had restored him to life .,surprise
"thank you pretty little maiden "" said the sick swallow; "" i have been so nicely warmed that i shall soon regain my strength and be able to fly about again in the warm sunshine .",joy
stay in your warm bed; i will take care of you .,joy
then she brought the swallow some water in a flower leaf and after he had drank he told her that he had wounded one of his wings in a thorn bush and could not fly as fast as the others who were soon far away on their journey to warm countries .,sadness
the whole winter the swallow remained underground and tiny nursed him with care and love .,joy
the sun shone in upon them so beautifully that the swallow asked her if she would go with him; she could sit on his back he said and he would fly away with her into the green woods .,joy
"but tiny knew it would make the field mouse very grieved if she left her in that manner so she said "" no i cannot .",sadness
tiny looked after him and the tears rose in her eyes .,sadness
"tweet tweet "" sang the bird as he flew out into the green woods and tiny felt very sad .",sadness
what good fortune for a poor child like you .,joy
nothing must be wanting when you are the mole ' s wife .,joy
but tiny was not at all pleased; for she did not like the tiresome mole .,sadness
every morning when the sun rose and every evening when it went down she would creep out at the door and as the wind blew aside the ears of corn so that she could see the blue sky she thought how beautiful and bright it seemed out there and wished so much to see her dear swallow again .,sadness
then tiny wept and said she would not marry the disagreeable mole .,sadness
"nonsense "" replied the field mouse .",anger
now don ' t be obstinate or i shall bite you with my white teeth .,anger
you ought to be very thankful for such good fortune .,anger
the poor child was very unhappy at the thought of saying farewell to the beautiful sun and as the field mouse had given her permission to stand at the door she went to look at it once more .,sadness
"farewell bright sun "" she cried stretching out her arm towards it; and then she walked a short distance from the house; for the corn had been cut and only the dry stubble remained in the fields .",sadness
"farewell farewell "" she repeated twining her arm round a little red flower that grew just by her side .",sadness
"tweet tweet "" sounded over her head suddenly .",surprise
she looked up and there was the swallow himself flying close by .,surprise
as soon as he spied tiny he was delighted; and then she told him how unwilling she felt to marry the ugly mole and to live always beneath the earth and never to see the bright sun any more .,joy
and as she told him she wept .,sadness
"yes i will go with you "" said tiny; and she seated herself on the bird ' s back with her feet on his outstretched wings and tied her girdle to one of his strongest feathers .",joy
you must choose for yourself one of those lovely flowers and i will put you down upon it and then you shall have everything that you can wish to make you happy .,joy
"that will be delightful "" she said and clapped her little hands for joy .",joy
but how surprised she was to see in the middle of the flower a tiny little man as white and transparent as if he had been made of crystal !,surprise
"oh how beautiful he is ! "" whispered tiny to the swallow .",joy
the little prince was at first quite frightened at the bird who was like a giant compared to such a delicate little creature as himself; but when he saw tiny he was delighted and thought her the prettiest little maiden he had ever seen .,joy
"this certainly was a very different sort of husband to the son of a toad or the mole with my black velvet and fur; so she said "" yes "" to the handsome prince .",joy
then all the flowers opened and out of each came a little lady or a tiny lord all so pretty it was quite a pleasure to look at them .,joy
then there was much rejoicing and the little swallow who sat above them in his nest was asked to sing a wedding song which he did as well as he could; but in his heart he felt sad for he was very fond of tiny and would have liked never to part from her again .,sadness
we will call you maia .,joy
"farewell farewell "" said the swallow with a heavy heart as he left the warm countries to fly back into denmark .",sadness
he still lay thinking and thinking when all at once it seemed as if some one kissed him on his eyes and mouth .,surprise
"he was very proud and said "" thorwalsden lived close to me and here i am now quite comfortable .",joy
but now little tuk was no longer in bed; all in a moment he found himself on horseback .,surprise
within there were songs and dancing; king waldemar and the young gayly dressed ladies of the court were dancing together .,joy
one tower after another fell till at last only one remained standing on the hill where the castle had formerly been .,surprise
but i am fragrant with perfume for close to my gates most lovely roses bloom .,joy
all at once everything vanished; but where !,surprise
"yes that it has "" said she and then just as she was going to tell him a great many pretty stories from holberg ' s comedies and about waldemar and absalom she suddenly shrunk up together and wagged her head as if she were a frog about to spring .",surprise
then little tuk saw she was changed into a frog .,surprise
how it sounded like the cry of the frogs on the moor or like the creaking of great boots when some one is marching always the same tone so monotonous and wearing that little tuk at length fell fast asleep and then the sound could not annoy him .,joy
the bird of good omen shall be yours and you shall become a rich and happy man; your house shall rise up like king waldemar ' s towers and shall be richly adorned with marble statues like those at prastoe .,joy
"understand me well; your name shall travel with fame round the world like the ship that was to sail from corsor and at roeskilde don ' t forget the names of the towns as king hroar said you shall speak well and clearly little tuk and when at last you lie in your grave you shall sleep peacefully as "" "" as if i lay in soroe "" said little tuk awaking .",joy
"the old washerwoman put her head in at the door and nodded to him quite kindly and said "" many thanks you good child for your help yesterday .",joy
i hope all your beautiful dreams will come true .,joy
she specially loved roses and therefore she possessed the most beautiful varieties of this flower from the wild hedge rose with its apple scented leaves to the splendid provence rose .,joy
but care and sorrow dwelt within these halls; the queen lay upon a sick bed and the doctors declared that she must die .,sadness
"no one has yet named the flower "" said the wise man .",sadness
no one has pointed out the spot where it blooms in all its splendor .,sadness
"i know where it blooms "" said a happy mother who came with her lovely child to the bedside of the queen .",joy
i know where the loveliest rose in the world is .,joy
it is seen on the blooming cheeks of my sweet child when it expresses the pure and holy love of infancy; when refreshed by sleep it opens its eyes and smiles upon me with childlike affection .,joy
she wept over it kissed it and prayed for it as only a mother can pray in that hour of her anguish .,sadness
"may she be blessed ! "" said the wise man : "" but no one has yet named the loveliest rose in the world .",joy
tears stood in his eyes and glistened on his cheeks; he carried a great book and the binding was of velvet with silver clasps .,sadness
"mother "" cried the little boy; "" only hear what i have read .",sadness
"he read "" greater love hath no man than this "" and as he read a roseate hue spread over the cheeks of the queen and her eyes became so enlightened and clear that she saw from the leaves of the book a lovely rose spring forth a type of him who shed his blood on the cross .",joy
"i see it "" she said .",joy
"hurrah ! hurrah ! "" cried the people in the town; for in every house the new year was being welcomed; and as the clock struck they stood up the full glasses in their hands to drink success to the new comer .",joy
"a happy new year "" was the cry; "" a pretty wife plenty of money and no sorrow or care .",joy
he seemed a merry fellow .,joy
"we ' ll dance the bung out of the cask at carnival time "" said he; "" i ' ll prepare a merry tune for you and for myself too .",joy
unfortunately i have not long to live the shortest time in fact of my whole family only twenty eight days .,sadness
hurrah !,joy
"you must not shout so "" said the sentry .",anger
but it was not true; the speaker only wanted to remind him of his name and to make an april fool of him; for with that fun the fourth generally began his career .,surprise
he looked very jovial did little work and had the more holidays .,joy
"your health and god bless you "" was her salutation to him .",joy
how pretty she was ! and such a singer ! not a theatre singer nor a ballad singer; no but a singer of the woods; for she wandered through the gay green forest and had a concert there for her own amusement .,joy
"now comes the young lady "" said those in the carriage; and out stepped a young dame delicate proud and pretty .",joy
"after work came the recreations dancing and playing in the greenwood and the "" harvest homes .",joy
this was an ornament to the jug and he has a great love for ornament .,joy
a land owner followed who in the month for sowing seed attended to the ploughing and was fond of field sports .,joy
it was november who coughed violently as he got out .,sadness
the dame was very old but her eyes glistened like two stars .,joy
"this tree i shall guard and cherish "" she said "" that it may grow large by christmas eve and reach from the ground to the ceiling to be covered and adorned with flaming candles golden apples and little figures .",joy
"well now the coach may drive away "" said the sentry; "" we have the whole twelve .",joy
it is quite a picture to see a half naked boy clasping the well formed creature by the head as he presses his rosy lips against its jaws .,surprise
in the garden of the grand duke ' s palace under the roof of one of the wings where a thousand roses bloom in winter a little ragged boy had been sitting the whole day long; a boy who might serve as a type of italy lovely and smiling and yet still suffering .,sadness
he was hungry and thirsty yet no one gave him anything; and when it became dark and they were about to close the gardens the porter turned him out .,sadness
"the metal pig raised himself gently and the boy heard him say quite distinctly "" hold tight little boy for i am going to run; "" and away he started for a most wonderful ride .",surprise
the little boy said not a word; he was half pleased and half afraid .,joy
but the grandest appeared when the door of a side room opened; the little boy could remember what beautiful things he had seen there but to night everything shone in its brightest colors .,joy
the boy was dazzled by so much glitter; for the walls were gleaming with bright colors all appeared living reality .,surprise
as they passed from hall to hall beauty everywhere showed itself; and as the metal pig went step by step from one picture to the other the little boy could see it all plainly .,joy
one glory eclipsed another; yet there was one picture that fixed itself on the little boy ' s memory more especially because of the happy children it represented for these the little boy had seen in daylight .,joy
the florentine angiolo bronzino painted this picture; most beautiful is the expression on the face of the two children who appear to have full confidence that they shall reach heaven at last .,joy
"they are embracing each other and one little one stretches out his hand towards another who stands below him and points to himself as if he were saying "" i am going to heaven .",joy
the older people stand as if uncertain yet hopeful and they bow in humble adoration to the lord jesus .,joy
the boy raised his hands towards the smiling children and then the pig ran off with him through the open vestibule .,joy
"thank you thank you you beautiful animal "" said the little boy caressing the metal pig as it ran down the steps .",joy
"thanks to yourself also "" replied the metal pig; "" i have helped you and you have helped me for it is only when i have an innocent child on my back that i receive the power to run .",joy
yes; as you see i can even venture under the rays of the lamp in front of the picture of the madonna but i may not enter the church; still from without and while you are upon my back i may look in through the open door .,sadness
"i will stay with you my dear creature "" said the little boy .",joy
the boy stretched forth his hands towards the light and at the same moment the metal pig started again so rapidly that he was obliged to cling tightly to him .,surprise
the wind whistled in his ears he heard the church door creak on its hinges as it closed and it seemed to him as if he had lost his senses then a cold shudder passed over him and he awoke .,surprise
once more he clasped the neck of his metal horse kissed its nose and nodded farewell to it .,sadness
another broken down staircase led from the gallery and two russian sailors running down it almost upset the poor boy .,surprise
this pot she took in her lap warmed her fingers and pushed the boy with her elbow .,surprise
"certainly you must have some money "" she said .",anger
the boy began to cry and then she struck him with her foot till he cried out louder .,sadness
"will you be quiet ? or i ' ll break your screaming head; "" and she swung about the fire pot which she held in her hand while the boy crouched to the earth and screamed .",anger
"felicita "" she said "" what are you doing to the child ?",anger
"the child is mine "" she answered; "" i can murder him if i like and you too giannina .",anger
and then she swung about the fire pot .,anger
here everything was bright and the boy knelt down by the first tomb on his right the grave of michael angelo and sobbed as if his heart would break .,sadness
hunger and thirst overpowered the child and he became quite faint and ill .,sadness
a little white poodle so closely shaven that his pink skin could plainly be seen frisked about the room and gambolled upon the boy .,joy
"innocent souls are soon intimate "" said the woman as she caressed both the boy and the dog .",joy
these good people gave the child food and drink and said he should stay with them all night and that the next day the old man who was called giuseppe would go and speak to his mother .,joy
a little homely bed was prepared for him but to him who had so often slept on the hard stones it was a royal couch and he slept sweetly and dreamed of the splendid pictures and of the metal pig .,joy
he wept at the thought and then he played with the little lively dog and kissed it while the old woman looked kindly at him to encourage him .,sadness
"then she said "" he is a good lad he shall stay with us he may become a clever glovemaker like you .",joy
so the boy stayed with them and the woman herself taught him to sew; and he ate well and slept well and became very merry .,joy
this made the woman angry and she scolded him and threatened him which made him very unhappy and he went and sat in his own room full of sad thoughts .,anger
suddenly he fancied he heard feet outside going pit a pat .,surprise
but there was nothing to be seen; whatever he had heard had passed already .,sadness
they stopped before the picture by bronzino in which christ is represented as standing in the lower world with the children smiling before him in the sweet expectation of entering heaven; and the poor boy smiled too for here was his heaven .,joy
"why don ' t you go ? "" said the painter .",anger
"you happy creature "" he said; "" how i have longed for you ! we must take a ride to night .",joy
but the metal pig lay motionless while the fresh stream gushed forth from its mouth .,surprise
"he looked down and there was bellissima little smooth shaven bellissima barking as if she would have said "" here i am too; why are you sitting there ?",surprise
"bellissima in the street and not dressed ! "" as the old lady called it; "" what would be the end of this ?",surprise
the poor little thing trembled so with cold that the boy ran homeward as fast as he could .,sadness
"where have you stolen that pretty dog ? "" they asked; and they took it away from him .",surprise
"oh i have not stolen it; do give it to me back again "" cried the boy despairingly .",anger
you bad boy ! how did you entice her out ?,anger
giuseppe went off at once while his wife lamented and the boy wept .,sadness
the painter however consoled the little fellow and tried to soften the lady ' s anger; but she would not be pacified till her husband returned with bellissima who had been with the police .,anger
then there was great rejoicing and the painter caressed the boy and gave him a number of pictures .,joy
oh what beautiful pictures these were ! figures with funny heads; and above all the metal pig was there too .,joy
oh nothing could be more delightful .,joy
the first leisure moment during the next day the boy got a pencil and on the back of one of the other drawings he attempted to copy the drawing of the metal pig and he succeeded .,joy
certainly it was rather crooked rather up and down one leg thick and another thin; still it was like the copy and he was overjoyed at what he had done .,joy
a second pig was drawn by the side of the first and this looked a hundred times better; and the third attempt was so good that everybody might know what it was meant to represent .,joy
"his collection of pictures increased; but as yet they were only copies of lifeless objects when one day bellissima came gambolling before him : "" stand still "" cried he "" and i will draw you beautifully to put amongst my collection .",joy
he tied her head and tail; but she barked and jumped and so pulled and tightened the string that she was nearly strangled; and just then her mistress walked in .,anger
"you wicked boy ! the poor little creature ! "" was all she could utter .",anger
she pushed the boy from her thrust him away with her foot called him a most ungrateful good for nothing wicked boy and forbade him to enter the house again .,anger
then she wept and kissed her little half strangled bellissima .,anger
a large gilt frame surrounded it and on one corner of the frame a laurel wreath had been hung; but a black band twined unseen among the green leaves and a streamer of crape hung down from it; for within the last few days the young artist had died .,sadness
he knew very well that he had enough inside him to buy up all the other toys and this gave him a very good opinion of his own value .,joy
upon this there was a great uproar; even the engravings which hung in frames on the wall turned round in their excitement and showed that they had a wrong side to them although they had not the least intention to expose themselves in this way or to object to the game .,joy
and as the game was now to begin all were invited to take part in it even the children ' s wagon which certainly belonged to the coarser playthings .,joy
when the play at the little theatre began the rest sat and looked on; they were requested to applaud and stamp or crack when they felt gratified with what they saw .,joy
"i crack for everybody "" said the cracker .",joy
"yes and a fine noise you make "" thought the audience as the play went on .",joy
the doll whose neck had been darned was so excited that the place in her neck burst and the money pig declared he must do something for one of the players as they had all pleased him so much .,joy
they all enjoyed the comedy so much that they gave up all thoughts of the tea party and only carried out their idea of intellectual amusement which they called playing at men and women; and there was nothing wrong about it for it was only play .,joy
certainly sooner than he expected for all at once down he came from the top of the press fell on the ground and was broken to pieces .,surprise
the sun shone among the delicate leaves; everything breathed forth the loveliest fragrance and all felt as we do when we are filled with joy at the thought of our happiness .,joy
"how beautiful existence is ! "" said each rose .",joy
we have good neighbours both below and above .,joy
how beautiful existence is !,joy
"if you must ask questions ask sensible ones "" said their mother .",anger
don ' t you see that they are feathers such as i wear and you will wear too ?,anger
i am very curious to know what the ducks were so startled about; not about us certainly although i did say ' peep ' to you pretty loudly .,surprise
the thick headed roses ought to know why but they know nothing at all; they only look at themselves and smell .,anger
i am heartily tired of such neighbours .,anger
what a pleasure that must be !,joy
it is fine to have such cheerful neighbours .,joy
"the other roses looked after their sister and asked each other "" where can she be going to ?",surprise
the whole day long the sun shines bright and warm and in the night the sky shines more beautifully still; we can see that through all the little holes in it .,joy
"we make it lively about the house "" said the sparrow mother; "" and people say that a swallows ' nest brings luck; so they are glad of us .",joy
but such neighbours as ours !,anger
the roses are good for nothing but to be looked at and to be smelt or at most to be stuck in a hat .,anger
you see that ' s their life; they exist only for the eye and the nose .,anger
but they were very pleased with it and wondered whether all the little sparrows could become nightingales .,joy
"nothing at all "" answered their mother; "" that ' s only something external .",anger
if they were only plucked a little they would look no better than the rest of us .,anger
i would have plucked them already if they had not been so big .,anger
in the farmhouse lived a young married couple; they loved each other dearly were industrious and active and everything in their home looked very nice .,joy
"now i see that it is sunday "" said the husband kissing his little wife .",joy
they sat down read their hymn book and held each other by the hand while the sun shone down upon the fresh roses and upon them .,joy
"this sight is really too tedious "" said the sparrow mother who could see into the room from her nest; and she flew away .",anger
in one of her flights however it may have happened she was caught before she was aware of it in a horse hair net which some boys had attached to a tree .,surprise
"it ' s only a sparrow "" they said; they did not however let her go but took her home with them and every time she cried they hit her on the beak .",anger
he was a merry old man always wandering about .,joy
how she glittered !,surprise
all the sparrows and even a crow and an old boy he was too were startled at the sight; but still they flew after her to learn what kind of strange bird she was .,surprise
look at her !,surprise
"look at her ! "" they all cried .",surprise
look at her !,surprise
"look at her "" cried her little ones . as she approached the nest .",surprise
that is certainly a young peacock for it glitters in all colours; it makes one ' s eyes ache as mother told us .,surprise
peep ! that ' s ' the beautiful ' .,surprise
"and then they pecked at the bird with their little beaks so that it was impossible for her to get into the nest; she was so exhausted that she couldn ' t even say "" peep ! "" much less "" i am your own mother !",sadness
"poor creature ! "" said all the roses; "" only be still and we will hide you .",sadness
the sparrow spread out her wings once more then drew them closely to her and lay dead near the neighbouring family the beautiful fresh roses .,surprise
"but i am the eldest ! "" exclaimed the third .",anger
then they all got excited; they hit out with their wings pecked with their beaks and flop ! one after another was thrown out of the nest .,anger
there they lay with their anger holding their heads on one side and blinking the eye that was turned upwards .,anger
in the night the red flames burst through the window and seized the roof the dry straw blazed up high and the whole house together with the young sparrow was burned .,surprise
a pleasanter picture cannot be imagined .,joy
"where is the house ? "" they asked .",surprise
where is the nest ?,surprise
all is burned and our strong brother too .,surprise
i don ' t want to talk to them and it looks miserable here that ' s my opinion .,anger
they are sparrows and good creatures .,joy
"here is excellent fare ! "" said the sparrow .",joy
"do you see that pouter pigeon ? "" said one to the other .",anger
she eats too many and the best ones too .,anger
how she lifts her crest the ugly spiteful creature !,anger
and the eyes of all sparkled with malice .,anger
the sparrows ate lustily; they listened attentively and even stood in the ranks with the others but it did not suit them at all .,sadness
they were full and so they left the pigeons exchanging opinions about them slipped in under the garden palings and when they found the door leading into the house open one of them who was more than full and therefore felt brave hopped on to the threshold .,joy
"peep ! "" said the sparrows "" it ' s nothing .",surprise
it only looks like something .,anger
peep ! that is ' the beautiful . ',surprise
the pigeons had often cooed not to say growled the spiteful creatures; the sparrows had been frozen in winter and had lived merrily in summer : they were all betrothed or married or whatever you like to call it .,joy
the windows of the house were broader at the bottom than at the top and when the sparrows looked through them every room appeared to them like a tulip with the brightest colours and shades .,joy
"how it shines ! how it shines ! "" said the maiden sparrow .",joy
i suppose that is ' the beautiful . ',joy
"a "" peep "" and three foot scrapings in this way she had often greeted throughout the year and no one here had responded for those who are once parted do not meet every day; and so this greeting had become a habit with her .",surprise
good day ! good day !,joy
this is ' the beautiful . ',joy
all stood with enraptured faces round thorwaldsen ' s grave and a few picked up the fallen rose leaves and preserved them .,joy
"peep ! "" they said sweeping the ground with their tails and blinking with one eye at the roses they had not looked at them long before they were convinced that they were their old neighbours .",surprise
the painter who had drawn the rose bush near the ruined house had afterwards obtained permission to dig it up and had given it to the architect for finer roses had never been seen .,joy
the roses nodded; they recognized their grey neighbours and were pleased to see them again .,joy
how glorious it is to live and to bloom to see old friends again and happy faces every day .,joy
it is as if every day were a festival .,joy
peep ! how they have got on .,joy
indeed everything in the emperor ' s garden was remarkable and it extended so far that the gardener himself did not know where it ended .,joy
"sometimes when they went at night to spread their nets they would hear her sing and say "" oh is not that beautiful ?",joy
"then they would hear it again and exclaim "" oh how beautiful is the nightingale ' s song !",joy
the books travelled all over the world and some of them came into the hands of the emperor; and he sat in his golden chair and as he read he nodded his approval every moment for it pleased him to find such a beautiful description of his city his palace and his gardens .,joy
"but when he came to the words "" the nightingale is the most beautiful of all "" he exclaimed "" what is this ?",surprise
i know nothing of any nightingale .,anger
is there such a bird in my empire ? and even in my garden ?,anger
"then he called one of his lords in waiting who was so high bred that when any in an inferior rank to himself spoke to him or asked him a question he would answer "" pooh "" which means nothing .",anger
"it is my pleasure that she shall appear this evening . "" said the emperor; the whole world knows what i possess better than i do myself .",joy
i will hear the nightingale she must be here this evening; she has my highest favor; and if she does not come the whole court shall be trampled upon after supper is ended .,anger
then the tears come into my eyes and it is just as if my mother kissed me .,joy
"hark hark ! there she is "" said the girl "" and there she sits "" she added pointing to a little gray bird who was perched on a bough .",joy
"is it possible ? "" said the lord in waiting "" i never imagined it would be a little plain simple thing like that .",surprise
"with the greatest pleasure "" said the nightingale and began to sing most delightfully .",joy
it is surprising that we have never heard this before; she will be a great success at court .,surprise
"my excellent little nightingale "" said the courtier "" i have the great pleasure of inviting you to a court festival this evening where you will gain imperial favor by your charming song .",joy
the nightingale sang so sweetly that the tears came into the emperor ' s eyes and then rolled down his cheeks as her song became still more touching and went to every one ' s heart .,joy
the emperor was so delighted that he declared the nightingale should have his gold slipper to wear round her neck but she declined the honor with thanks : she had been sufficiently rewarded already .,joy
"i have seen tears in an emperor ' s eyes "" she said "" that is my richest reward .",joy
"an emperor ' s tears have wonderful power and are quite sufficient honor for me; "" and then she sang again more enchantingly than ever .",joy
"that singing is a lovely gift; "" said the ladies of the court to each other; and then they took water in their mouths to make them utter the gurgling sounds of the nightingale when they spoke to any one so thay they might fancy themselves nightingales .",joy
and the footmen and chambermaids also expressed their satisfaction which is saying a great deal for they are very difficult to please .,joy
there was certainly not much pleasure in this kind of flying .,sadness
"round its neck hung a piece of ribbon on which was written "" the emperor of china ' s nightingale is poor compared with that of the emperor of japan ' s .",surprise
"now they must sing together "" said the court "" and what a duet it will be .",joy
but they did not get on well for the real nightingale sang in its own natural way but the artificial bird sang only waltzes .,sadness
three and thirty times did it sing the same tunes without being tired; the people would gladly have heard it again but the emperor said the living nightingale ought to sing something .,joy
"what strange conduct "" said the emperor when her flight had been discovered; and all the courtiers blamed her and said she was a very ungrateful creature .",surprise
but the music master praised the bird in the highest degree and even asserted that it was better than a real nightingale not only in its dress and the beautiful diamonds but also in its musical power .,joy
when they heard it they were like people intoxicated; however it must have been with drinking tea which is quite a chinese custom .,joy
and after this the real nightingale was banished from the empire and the artificial bird placed on a silk cushion close to the emperor ' s bed .,surprise
so a year passed and the emperor the court and all the other chinese knew every little turn in the artificial bird ' s song; and for that same reason it pleased them better .,joy
then a spring cracked .,surprise
the emperor immediately sprang out of bed and called for his physician; but what could he do ?,surprise
now there was great sorrow as the bird could only be allowed to play once a year; and even that was dangerous for the works inside it .,sadness
five years passed and then a real grief came upon the land .,sadness
the chinese really were fond of their emperor and he now lay so ill that he was not expected to live .,sadness
"already a new emperor had been chosen and the people who stood in the street asked the lord in waiting how the old emperor was; but he only said "" pooh ! "" and shook his head .",anger
cold and pale lay the emperor in his royal bed; the whole court thought he was dead and every one ran away to pay homage to his successor .,sadness
the poor emperor finding he could scarcely breathe with a strange weight on his chest opened his eyes and saw death sitting there .,surprise
sing ! sing !,anger
thanks thanks you heavenly little bird .,joy
i banished you from my kingdom once and yet you have charmed away the evil faces from my bed and banished death from my heart with your sweet song .,joy
"you have already rewarded me "" said the nightingale .",joy
i shall never forget that i drew tears from your eyes the first time i sang to you .,joy
these are the jewels that rejoice a singer ' s heart .,joy
and as she sung the emperor fell into a sweet sleep; and how mild and refreshing that slumber was !,joy
"you must always remain with me "" said the emperor .",joy
i will sit on a bough outside your window in the evening and sing to you so that you may be happy and have thoughts full of joy .,joy
i love your heart better than your crown; and yet something holy lingers round that also .,joy
"the servants now came in to look after the dead emperor; when lo ! there he stood and to their astonishment said "" good morning .",surprise
"that was a terrible affair ! "" said a hen and in a quarter of the town too where it had not taken place .",anger
that was a terrible affair in a hen roost .,anger
"there it goes "" she said; "" the more i pluck the more beautiful do i get .",joy
she said this merrily for she was the best of the hens and moreover as had been said very respectable .,joy
it was dark all around and hen sat close to hen but the one who sat nearest to her merry neighbour did not sleep .,joy
did you hear what was said ?,surprise
i mention no names but there is a hen here who intends to pluck herself in order to look well .,anger
if i were a cock i should despise her .,anger
"they rolled their eyes and mother owl beating her wings said : "" don ' t listen to her !",anger
there is one among the fowls who has so far forgotten what is becoming to a hen that she plucks out all her feathers and lets the cock see it .,anger
"prenez garde aux enfants ! "" said father owl; "" children should not hear such things .",anger
"where ? where ? "" cooed the doves .",surprise
it is almost unbecoming to tell the story but there is no doubt about it .,anger
it is a dangerous game for one can easily catch cold and die from fever and both of these are dead already .,anger
they had plucked out all their feathers .,surprise
it is a horrible story : i will not keep it to myself but let it go farther .,anger
"the hen who had lost the loose little feather naturally did not recognise her own story and being a respectable hen said : "" i despise those fowls; but there are more of that kind .",anger
"we ' ll have a play too "" he said "" and it may begin immediately .",joy
"but we have no theatre "" cried little anna "" and we have no one to act for us; my old doll cannot for she is a fright and my new one cannot for she must not rumple her new clothes .",sadness
row dow dow ! how they can stamp and strut !,joy
"a domestic drama please "" said little anna "" for the others are so fond of that .",joy
he ' s angry to day .,anger
' snik snak snurre bassellurre !,anger
i ' m master of this house !,anger
snikke snakke snak !,anger
"the waistcoat has a laydown collar and is very modest; but he knows his own value and has quite a right to say what he says : "" ' i haven ' t a spot on me !",joy
i am of real silk and have strings to me . ',joy
' could i but have my love who then so happy as glove !,joy
if i from him must part i ' m sure ' twill break my heart ! ' ' bah ! ',anger
' o glove my own dear though it cost thee a tear thou must be mine for holger danske has sworn it ! ',joy
mr . de boots hearing this kicks up jingles his spurs and knocks down three of the side scenes .,surprise
"that ' s exceedingly charming ! "" cried little anna .",joy
now comes the exciting part little anna .,joy
that ' s a most charming comedy .,joy
"mr . waistcoat seized the old pipe head and put him in his pocket; there he lies and the waistcoat says : "" ' you are in my pocket; you can ' t come out till you promise to unite me to your daughter glove on the left .",surprise
"that ' s awfully pretty "" said little anna .",joy
' though i ' m all ear very stupid i appear : where ' s my humor ?,sadness
gone i fear and i feel my hollow stick ' s not here ah ! never my dear did i feel so queer .,anger
oh ! pray let me out and like a lamb led to slaughter i ' ll betroth you no doubt to my daughter . ',anger
"and now we ' ll applaud "" said grandpapa .",joy
"our play is much better "" said grandpapa .",joy
many of them were very aged; lonely old boys with strange thoughts and eccentric habits .,sadness
and when at last he crept into bed he would be so cold that his teeth chattered in his head .,sadness
but this was scarcely an agreeable entertainment; for thoughts of olden memories raise the curtains from the past and sometimes pierce the heart with painful recollections till the agony brings tears to the waking eyes .,sadness
and so it was with anthony; often the scalding tears like pearly drops would fall from his eyes to the coverlet and roll on the floor with a sound as if one of his heartstrings had broken .,sadness
if he dried his eyes with his nightcap then the tear and the picture would be crushed; but the source of the tears remained and welled up again in his heart .,sadness
the pictures did not follow one another in order as the circumstances they represented had occurred; very often the most painful would come together and when those came which were most full of joy they had always the deepest shadow thrown upon them .,sadness
how vividly were represented to him in a glittering tear that rolled down his cheek two children at play a boy and a girl .,sadness
then they got a flower pot filled it with earth and were soon both very busy and eager about it .,joy
"they are molly and me "" said the boy .",joy
how wonderful they are and so beautiful !,joy
and all this about the two children was mirrored to old anthony in a single tear which could soon be wiped away and disappear but might come again from its source in the heart of the old man .,sadness
"i may kiss him "" she would say proudly as she threw her arms round his neck; she was vain of her power over anthony for he would submit quietly and think nothing of it .",joy
and molly and anthony both wept but these tears all flowed together into one tear which had the rosy shimmer of joy .,sadness
molly had told him that she loved him loved him more than all the splendors of weimar .,joy
one two three years went by and during the whole time he received only two letters .,sadness
one stanza pleased him exceedingly,joy
through the forest and in the vale sweetly warbles the nightingale .,joy
he was received with a hearty welcome and introduced to plenty of grand and pleasant company where overflowing winecups were passed about .,joy
"anthony also said "" farewell .",sadness
not a tear came into his eye; he felt he was no longer molly ' s friend .,sadness
hot iron and cold iron alike take the skin from our lips and we feel the same sensation if we kiss either; and anthony ' s kiss was now the kiss of hatred as it had once been the kiss of love .,anger
"what matters it ? "" said he; "" i am ruined also .",sadness
i will destroy everything that can remind me of her or of lady halle or lady venus the heathen woman .,anger
i will break down the apple tree and tear it up by the roots; never more shall it blossom or bear fruit .,anger
dark days heavy trials with poverty at the door came rolling into the house upon them like the waves of the sea .,sadness
sorrow and suffering deprived anthony ' s father of his strength so that he had something else to think of besides nursing his love sorrows and his anger against molly .,sadness
how different the world and the people in it appeared to anthony now to what he had thought in his childhood !,surprise
at times he would think in this way; yet again and again the songs would sound in his soul and his heart become gentle and pious .,joy
"god ' s will is the best "" he would then say .",joy
all has happened for the best .,joy
she could not help it and yet i have been so bitter and in such enmity against her .,anger
how much came back to his remembrance as he looked through the tears once more on his native town !,sadness
"that flourishes still "" said he as he gazed .",joy
"the blossoms are often plucked "" said anthony; "" the fruit is stolen and the branches broken without a thankful thought of their profusion and beauty .",anger
forsaken and forgotten in a garden by a hedge in a field and close to a public road .,anger
there it stands unsheltered plundered and broken .,anger
it certainly has not yet withered; but in the course of years the number of blossoms from time to time will grow less and at last it was cease altogether to bear fruit; and then its history will be over .,sadness
"marry ! ha ha ! "" and he laughed bitterly to himself at the thought .",sadness
there lay the old bachelor forsaken by all and unable to help himself .,sadness
a little spider which he could however not see busily and cheerfully spun its web above him so that there should be a kind of little banner waving over the old man when his eyes closed .,joy
the recollection of her pious deeds was as light to the soul of poor anthony .,joy
then he tore away the cloth which covered the basket and what could equal the surprise of the pious woman to find that by a miracle everything in her basket the wine the bread had all been changed into roses .,surprise
in this way the memory of the kind lady dwelt in the calm mind of anthony .,joy
he saw the branches of an apple tree spreading above him .,joy
the fragrant leaves of the tree fell upon him and cooled his burning brow; upon his parched lips they seemed like refreshing bread and wine; and as they rested on his breast a peaceful calm stole over him and he felt inclined to sleep .,joy
glorious ! wonderful !,joy
that apple tree planted in love now appears before me in heavenly beauty .,joy
"hallo ! how the nightcap burns ! "" he exclaimed as he tore it from his bead .",surprise
it was the hour of the mother ' s sorrow when there pealed forth from the church tower the sound of festive bells .,sadness
in that solemn hour the sweet and joyous chiming filled the hearts of those in the humble dwelling with thankfulness and trust; and when amidst these joyous sounds a little son was born to them the words of prayer and praise arose from their overflowing hearts and their happiness seemed to ring out over town and country in the liquid tones of the church bells ' chime .,joy
the little one with its bright eyes and golden hair had been welcomed joyously on that dark november day .,joy
"its parents kissed it lovingly and the father wrote these words in the bible "" on the tenth of november 1759 god sent us a son .",joy
he and his sister two years older than himself had often wept scalding tears over the story of him who suffered death on the cross for us all .,sadness
his mother also told him how the chiming of that old bell had once filled her heart with joy and confidence and that in the midst of the sweet tones her child had been given to her .,joy
he bowed his head over it and kissed it old thrown away and cracked as it was and standing there amidst the grass and nettles .,joy
a record of this bright display will live in the memory of man for through it the pupil in the military school was in tears and sorrow .,sadness
dark days and cold nights also passed over the old bell and it noticed them not; but the bell in the man ' s heart felt it to be a gloomy time .,sadness
the maids often laid the clean copper saucepans and kitchen vessels on this stone that they might dry in the sun and the children were fond of playing on it .,joy
dear me ! how singular .,surprise
why that must be the grave stone of preben schwane and his wife .,surprise
preben and martha were a fine old couple and when they both sat on the bench at the top of the steep stone steps in front of their house with the branches of the linden tree waving above them and nodded in a gentle friendly way to passers by it really made one feel quite happy .,joy
the corpse lay in a bedroom near to the one in which we sat and the old man was in great distress and weeping like a child .,sadness
he spoke to my father and to a few neighbors who were there of how lonely he should feel now she was gone and how good and true she his dead wife had been during the number of years that they had passed through life together and how they had become acquainted and learnt to love each other .,sadness
i was as i have said a boy and only stood by and listened to what the others said; but it filled me with a strange emotion to listen to the old man and to watch how the color rose in his cheeks as he spoke of the days of their courtship of how beautiful she was and how many little tricks he had been guilty of that he might meet her .,surprise
and then he talked of his wedding day; and his eyes brightened and he seemed to be carried back by his words to that joyful time .,joy
"and the old man who had spoken of all this shook his head mournfully and said "" forgotten !",sadness
ah yes everything will be forgotten !,sadness
all that the boy had heard of old preben and his wife seemed clearly defined on the stone and as he gazed on it and glanced at the clear bright moon shining in the pure air it was as if the light of god ' s countenance beamed over his beautiful world .,joy
forgotten !,surprise
the old pair shall again wander through the streets arm in arm or sit with their fresh healthy cheeks on the bench under the lime tree and smile and nod at rich and poor .,joy
at the window of one of them sat a little boy with fresh rosy cheeks and clear sparkling eyes who was very fond of the old house in sunshine or in moonlight .,joy
certainly it was a very good house to look at for amusement .,joy
"the little boy one day heard his parents say "" the old man opposite is very well off but is terribly lonely .",sadness
and the old attendant nodded and looked very pleased and then he carried the tin soldier into the house .,joy
oh dear how i am creaking .,anger
gout in my back ugh .,anger
"thank you for the tin soldier my little friend "" said the old man "" and thank you also for coming to see me .",joy
"thanks thanks "" or "" creak creak "" said all the furniture .",joy
"oh "" replied the old man "" i have pleasant thoughts of all that has passed recalled by memory; and now you are come to visit me and that is very pleasant .",joy
it was very pleasant certainly to be in that old house .,joy
"i cannot endure it "" said the tin soldier who stood on a shelf "" it is so lonely and dull here .",sadness
i have been accustomed to live in a family and i cannot get used to this life .,sadness
i cannot bear it .,sadness
it is not here like it was in your house opposite when your father and mother talked so cheerfully together while you and all the dear children made such a delightful noise .,joy
no it is all lonely in the old man ' s house .,sadness
oh i cannot bear it .,sadness
"ah but i never see any and i don ' t know them "" said the tin soldier "" and i cannot bear it .",sadness
then the old man came back with a pleasant face; and brought with him beautiful preserved fruits as well as apples and nuts; and the little boy thought no more of the tin soldier .,joy
how happy and delighted the little boy was; and after he returned home and while days and weeks passed a great deal of nodding took place from one house to the other and then the little boy went to pay another visit .,joy
"i cannot bear it any longer "" said the tin soldier; "" i have wept tears of tin it is so melancholy here .",sadness
let me go to the wars and lose an arm or a leg that would be some change; i cannot bear it .,sadness
i have had visits from mine and you may believe me it is not altogether pleasant .,sadness
you all stood looking very grave although it was very difficult to do so but i laughed so to myself that i fell down from the table and got a bruise which is there still; i know it was not right to laugh .,joy
ah really he must be very happy; i cannot endure this life .,sadness
"then he looked at the picture he had bought at the broker ' s and his eyes sparkled brightly as he nodded at it and said "" ah she could sing that tune .",joy
i will go to the wars !,sadness
"i will go to the wars ! "" cried the tin soldier as loud as he could and threw himself down on the floor .",sadness
and indeed nobody was home for the old man was dead .,surprise
he was to be taken to the country to be buried there in his own grave; so they carried him away; no one followed him for all his friends were dead; and the little boy kissed his hand to the coffin as the hearse moved away with it .,sadness
the sparrows assembled in dozens upon the wild vines and chattered all together as loud as they could but not about the old house; none of them could remember it for many years had passed by so many indeed that the little boy was now a man and a really good man too and his parents were very proud of him .,joy
he was just married and had come with his young wife to reside in the new house with the garden in front of it and now he stood there by her side while she planted a field flower that she thought very pretty .,joy
"oh dear what was that ? "" she exclaimed as something pricked her .",surprise
it was only think ! it was really the tin soldier the very same which had been lost up in the old man ' s room and had been hidden among old wood and rubbish for a long time till it sunk into the earth where it must have been for many years .,surprise
and the tin soldier felt as if he was recovering from a fainting fit .,joy
"let me see him "" said the young man and then he smiled and shook his head and said "" it can scarcely be the same but it reminds me of something that happened to one of my tin soldiers when i was a little boy .",joy
and then he told his wife about the old house and the old man and of the tin soldier which he had sent across because he thought the old man was lonely; and he related the story so clearly that tears came into the eyes of the young wife for the old house and the old man .,joy
"oh how dreadfully lonely he must have been "" said she .",sadness
"yes terribly lonely "" cried the tin soldier; "" still it is delightful not to be forgotten .",joy
he bent his head mournfully and sighed in deep sorrow as an unquiet spirit might sigh .,sadness
"and the dead man answered "" no one has sung the deeds of my life; they are dead and forgotten .",sadness
song doth not carry them forth over the lands nor into the hearts of men; therefore i have no rest and no peace .,sadness
then the face of the dead one gleamed like the margin of the cloud in the moonlight .,joy
gladly and of good courage the form arose in splendor and in majesty and vanished like the glancing of the northern light .,joy
and over the buried town fly the birds of heaven the small and the great; they twitter and they sing as best they may each bird with his beak .,joy
"we know the buried town "" they say; "" everything living in it is piep ! piep ! piep !",joy
no death is there life reigns yonder; we hear it on the notes that swell onward like the tones of the church organ which seize us like sounds from the elf hill like the songs of ossian like the rushing swoop of the wandering spirits ' wings .,joy
"he annoys me with his loud crowing "" said the portuguese duck; "" but still he ' s a handsome bird there ' s no denying that although he ' s not a drake .",anger
how sweetly they sing there; it is quite a pleasure to listen to them !,joy
"that ' s just like the cat she ' s a villain "" said the portuguese duck .",anger
how can such a creature be allowed to live and wander about upon the roofs .,anger
she pitied the little singing bird and so did all the other ducks who were not portuguese .,sadness
"poor little creature ! "" they said one after another as they came up .",sadness
"tweet tweet ! "" said the little bird for one of his wings being broken he found it difficult to shake himself; but he quite understood that the bath was meant kindly and he said "" you are very kind hearted madam; "" but he did not wish for a second bath .",joy
"i have never thought about my heart "" replied the portuguese duck "" but i know that i love all my fellow creatures except the cat and nobody can expect me to love her for she ate up two of my ducklings .",joy
"don ' t plague him so interposed the portuguese duck; "" he requires rest and nursing .",anger
"oh no ! no ! pray let me dry "" implored the little bird .",surprise
amusement too is very beneficial .,joy
the two chinese were quite enchanted with the appearance of the singing bird .,joy
"he ' s charming "" they said to each other and began a conversation with him in whispers using the most aristocratic chinese dialect : "" we are of the same race as yourself "" they said .",joy
it cannot even be said of the ducks and we warn you little bird not to trust that one yonder with the short tail feathers for she is cunning; that curiously marked one with the crooked stripes on her wings is a mischief maker and never lets any one have the last word though she is always in the wrong .,anger
that fat duck yonder speaks evil of every one and that is against our principles .,anger
"i wonder what those two chinese are whispering about "" whispered one duck to another; "" they are always doing it and it annoys me .",anger
so she laid herself down in the sun and winked with one eye; she had a very comfortable place and felt so comfortable that she fell asleep .,joy
the sun shone warm and bright and he found out that it was a very good place .,joy
"the witty little duck said of the portuguese that the old lady was getting quite a "" doting ducky "" all the other ducks laughed at this .",anger
"and then they repeated the former joke about "" portulak "" and declared it was most amusing .",joy
the portuguese awoke too and rushed over to the other side : in so doing she trod upon the little singing bird .,surprise
"tweet "" he cried; "" you trod very hard upon me madam .",sadness
"well then why do you lie in my way ? "" she retorted "" you must not be so touchy .",anger
i have nerves of my own but i do not cry ' tweet . ',anger
"don ' t be angry "" said the little bird; "" the ' tweet ' slipped out of my beak unawares .",sadness
when she had finished she lay down again and the little bird who wished to be amiable began to sing,joy
"now i want rest after my dinner "" said the portuguese; "" you must conform to the rules of the house while you are here .",anger
the little bird was quite taken aback for he meant it kindly .,surprise
when madam awoke afterwards there he stood before her with a little corn he had found and laid it at her feet; but as she had not slept well she was naturally in a bad temper .,anger
"give that to a chicken "" she said "" and don ' t be always standing in my way .",anger
"why are you angry with me ? "" replied the little singing bird "" what have i done ?",sadness
"done ! "" repeated the portuguese duck "" your mode of expressing yourself is not very polite .",anger
"it was sunshine here yesterday "" said the little bird "" but to day it is cloudy and the air is close .",sadness
don ' t stand there looking so stupid .,anger
"impertinent creature ! "" exclaimed the portuguese duck : "" would you compare me with the cat that beast of prey ?",anger
there ' s not a drop of malicious blood in me .,anger
so saying she made a bite at the little singing bird ' s head and he fell dead on the ground .,anger
"she said; "" could he not bear even such a little peck as i gave him ?",anger
then certainly he was not made for this world .,anger
"you ' ll kill me with your crowing "" she cried "" it ' s all your fault .",anger
he ' s lost his life and i ' m very near losing mine .,anger
there was nothing to envy here so they all showed a great deal of pity even the two chinese .,sadness
"we shall never have another singing bird again amongst us; he was almost a chinese "" they whispered and then they wept with such a noisy clucking sound that all the other fowls clucked too but the ducks went about with redder eyes afterwards .",sadness
"i obtained the first prize "" said the hare .",joy
"justice must still be carried out even when one has relations and good friends among the prize committee; but that the snail should have received the second prize i consider almost an insult to myself "" "" no "" said the fence rail who had been a witness at the distribution of prizes; "" there should be some consideration for industry and perseverance .",anger
i should imagine no one can be swifter in soaring and flight than i am; and how far i have been ! far far away .,joy
you have no love of fatherland in you .,anger
"i deserved the first prize and not the second "" said the snail .",anger
i know so much at least that the hare only ran from cowardice and because he thought there was danger in delay .,anger
but i do not understand chattering and boasting; on the contrary i despise it .,anger
and the snail spat at them with contempt .,anger
it seemed as if i saw myself again in the days of my childhood; and so i voted for the hare .,joy
i call that conquering him; but i do not want the prize .,joy
our worshipful judges don ' t appear to have noticed this at all .,anger
were i the sunbeam i would give each one of them a sun stroke; but that would only make them mad and they are mad enough already .,anger
it is glorious to bloom to be fragrant and to live; to live in story and in song .,joy
"just then a large old carriage came by and in it sat an old lady; she looked at the little girl and taking pity on her said to the clergyman "" look here if you will give me the little girl i will take care of her .",sadness
karen believed that this was all on account of the red shoes but the old lady thought them hideous and so they were burnt .,anger
"yes they do shine "" said karen .",joy
she said that it was a shocking thing to do that it was very improper and that karen was always to go to church in future in black shoes even if they were old .,surprise
"dear me what pretty dancing shoes ! "" said the soldier .",surprise
"sit fast when you dance "" said he addressing the shoes and slapping the soles with his hand .",joy
"but it was the old soldier with the red beard; he sat there nodding his head and said : "" dear me what pretty dancing shoes !",surprise
"dance you shall "" said he "" dance in your red shoes till you are pale and cold till your skin shrivels up and you are a skeleton !",anger
dance you shall from door to door and where proud and wicked children live you shall knock so that they may hear you and fear you !,anger
dance you shall dance !,anger
and he carved her a pair of wooden feet and some crutches and taught her a psalm which is always sung by sinners; she kissed the hand that guided the axe and went away over the heath .,joy
"during the whole week she was sad and wept many bitter tears but when sunday came again she said : "" now i have suffered and striven enough .",sadness
on the following sunday they all went to church and she was asked whether she wished to go too; but with tears in her eyes she looked sadly at her crutches .,sadness
"here she sat down with her hymn book and as she was reading it with a pious mind the wind carried the notes of the organ over to her from the church and in tears she lifted up her face and said : "" o god ! help me !",sadness
"it was mercy "" said she .",joy
the bright warm sunshine streamed through the window into the pew where karen sat and her heart became so filled with it so filled with peace and joy that it broke .,joy
her soul flew on the sunbeams to heaven and no one was there who asked after the red shoes .,joy
"upon my word "" said the shirt collar "" i have never seen anything so slim and delicate so neat and soft before .",joy
i see that you are useful as well as ornamental my little lady .,joy
"you must not speak to me "" said the garter; "" i do not think i have given you any encouragement to do so .",anger
"get away; don ' t come so near me "" said the garter "" you appear to me quite like a man .",anger
"i am a fine gentleman certainly "" said the shirt collar "" i possess a boot jack and a hair brush .",joy
"don ' t come so near me "" said the garter; "" i am not accustomed to it .",anger
"affectation ! "" said the shirt collar .",joy
"mistress widow "" said the shirt collar "" little mistress widow i feel quite warm .",joy
you are burning a hole in me .,anger
ugh !,anger
"you old rag "" said the flat iron driving proudly over the collar for she fancied herself a steam engine which rolls over the railway and draws carriages .",anger
"you old rag ! "" said she .",anger
"oh ! "" exclaimed the shirt collar "" what a first rate dancer you would make; you can stretch out your leg so well .",joy
i never saw anything so charming; i am sure no human being could do the same .,joy
i wish i had an estate for your sake .,sadness
"what ! is he going to propose to me ? "" said the scissors and she became so angry that she cut too sharply into the shirt collar and it was obliged to be thrown by as useless .",anger
"engaged ! "" cried the shirt collar "" now there is no one left to propose to; "" and then he pretended to despise all love making .",surprise
yes i have had great experience of this kind but my greatest grief was for the garter the girdle i meant to say that jumped into the wash tub .,sadness
i have a great deal on my conscience and it is really time i should be turned into white paper .,sadness
"it is so delightfully cold "" said the snow man "" that it makes my whole body crackle .",joy
this is just the kind of wind to blow life into one .,joy
how that great red thing up there is staring at me !,surprise
he had been brought into existence amidst the joyous shouts of boys the jingling of sleigh bells and the slashing of whips .,joy
ah i have cured him of staring though; now he may hang up there and shine that i may see myself .,joy
if i only knew how to manage to move away from this place i should so like to move .,sadness
if i could i would slide along yonder on the ice as i have seen the boys do; but i don ' t understand how; i don ' t even know how to run .,sadness
"away away "" barked the old yard dog .",anger
"you know nothing at all "" replied the yard dog; "" but then you ' ve only lately been patched up .",anger
"this is really beautiful "" said a young girl who had come into the garden with a young man; and they both stood still near the snow man and contemplated the glittering scene .",joy
"summer cannot show a more beautiful sight "" she exclaimed while her eyes sparkled .",joy
the girl laughed and nodded at the snow man and then tripped away over the snow with her friend .,joy
"well they belong to the same master "" retorted the yard dog .",anger
certainly people who were only born yesterday know very little .,anger
i can see that in you .,anger
"the cold is delightful "" said the snow man; "" but do tell me tell me; only you must not clank your chain so; for it jars all through me when you do that .",anger
ah i still dream of that stove .,sadness
the snow man felt quite a strange sensation come over him; it was very odd he knew not what it meant and he could not account for it .,surprise
"i was obliged "" replied the yard dog .",sadness
they turned me out of doors and chained me up here .,sadness
' bone for bone ' i thought; but they were so angry and from that time i have been fastened with a chain and lost my bone .,sadness
i can ' t talk any more like other dogs .,sadness
away away that is the end of it all .,sadness
"what a strange crackling i feel within me "" he said .",surprise
i must go in there and lean against her even if i have to break the window .,surprise
"you must never go in there "" said the yard dog "" for if you approach the stove you ' ll melt away away .",surprise
"i can endure it no longer "" said he; "" how beautiful it looks when it stretches out its tongue ?",anger
the night was long but did not appear so to the snow man who stood there enjoying his own reflections and crackling with the cold .,joy
"but he did not enjoy it; how indeed could he enjoy anything when he was "" stove sick ?",anger
"ah now i understand why he had such a great longing for the stove "" said the yard dog .",joy
why there ' s the shovel that is used for cleaning out the stove fastened to the pole .,surprise
but the girls in the house sang,joy
"your ' something ' is not enough for me "" said the second brother; "" what you talk of doing is nothing at all it is journeyman ' s work or might even be done by a machine .",anger
no !,anger
"i call it all nothing "" said the third; "" not in reality any position .",anger
"not in my opinion "" said the fourth; "" i will never follow the lead of others and only imitate what they have done .",anger
"people said of this fifth brother "" there is something very precise about him; he has a good head piece but he does nothing .",surprise
the eldest brother he who fabricated bricks soon discovered that each brick when finished brought him in a small coin if only a copper one; and many copper pieces if placed one upon another can be changed into a shining shilling; and at whatever door a person knocks who has a number of these in his hands whether it be the baker ' s the butcher ' s or the tailor ' s the door flies open and he can get all he wants .,surprise
while young i can wander without a care and build new houses everywhere; fair and bright are my dreams of home always thought of wherever i roam .,joy
hurrah for a workman ' s life of glee !,joy
it was really a pretty house and in it were a happy pair .,joy
"the flag of the corporation fluttered before it and the journeymen and apprentices shouted "" hurrah .",joy
"it is evidently for the sake of contrast that i and this wretched soul should arrive here exactly at the same time "" said the critic .",anger
"in what manner did you leave the world ? "" he asked just for the sake of saying something; for it made him feel very weary to stand there and wait .",anger
"how i left the world ? "" she replied; "" why i can scarcely tell you .",surprise
twice in my life had i seen this same thing and i knew that there would be an awful storm with a spring tide which would overwhelm the poor people who were now out on the ice drinking dancing and making merry .,joy
i saw the people outside running and jumping about on the ice; i saw the beautiful flags waving in the wind; i heard the boys shouting ' hurrah ! ' and the lads and lasses singing and everything full of merriment and joy .,joy
they could not hear me and to go to them was quite out of my power .,sadness
oh if i could only get them safe on land !,sadness
i escaped fortunately as far as the threshold of the door; but there i fell down and remained : i could go no farther .,sadness
the flames rushed out towards me flickered on the window and rose high above the roof .,sadness
but the people had reached the sea wall where the sparks were flying round .,joy
i had saved them all; but i suppose i could not survive the cold and fright; so i came up here to the gates of paradise .,joy
"see "" said the angel pointing to the wonderful straw "" this is what the poor woman has brought .",joy
i know thou hast accomplished nothing not even made a single brick .,anger
but thou canst not return to earth and i can do nothing for thee .,anger
"it must look very grand "" thought he "" for my wife to have a sentry guarding her nest .",joy
"never mind what they say; you need not listen "" said the mother .",anger
but the boys went on singing and pointing at the storks and mocking at them excepting one of the boys whose name was peter; he said it was a shame to make fun of animals and would not join with them at all .,anger
"no certainly not "" said the mother .",anger
then we may be killed after all as the boys say; and hark ! they are singing again .,surprise
"listen to me and not to them "" said the mother stork .",anger
"oh o h ! "" cried the young storks .",surprise
"i don ' t want to fly "" said one of the young storks creeping back into the nest .",anger
i don ' t care about going to warm countries .,anger
"would you like to stay here and freeze when the winter comes ? "" said the mother "" or till the boys comes to hang you or to roast you ? well then i ' ll call them .",anger
"shall we fly down and pick their eyes out ? "" asked the young storks .",anger
that last flap of the wings was so easy and graceful that i shall give you permission to fly with me to morrow to the marshes .,joy
you must strut about proudly it will look well and make you respected .,joy
"but may we not punish those naughty boys ? "" asked the young storks .",anger
"we will revenge ourselves "" whispered the young storks to each other as they again joined the exercising .",anger
the young storks were very angry and grew worse as they grew older; so at last their mother was obliged to promise that they should be revenged but not until the day of their departure .,anger
"now let us have our revenge "" they cried .",joy
"yes certainly "" cried the mother stork .",joy
i have thought upon the best way to be revenged .,joy
"but the naughty boy who began the song first what shall we do to him ? "" cried the young storks .",anger
we will take it to the naughty boy and he will cry because we have brought him a little dead brother .,sadness
and what stories grandpapa could tell !,joy
"one never forgets a feast like that however old one may grow "" said grandfather .",joy
it was a terrible night and in the morning only think ! nearly all the shields had changed places .,surprise
in some places the inscriptions were so malicious that grandfather would not speak of them at all; but i saw that he was chuckling secretly and there may have been some inaccuracy in his description after all .,joy
"the emperor ordered them to be carried into the great hall where the princess was just playing "" visitors are coming "" with her ladies in waiting; when she saw the large cases with the presents therein she clapped her hands for joy .",joy
"oh how nicely it is made "" exclaimed the ladies .",joy
"it is more than nice "" said the emperor "" it is charming .",joy
the princess touched it and nearly began to cry .,surprise
"for shame pa "" she said "" it is not artificial it is natural !",surprise
"for shame it is natural "" repeated all her ladies .",anger
"superbe charmant "" said the ladies of the court for they all prattled french one worse than the other .",joy
"you are right "" said the emperor and began to cry like a little child .",sadness
but the prince was not discouraged .,joy
when the princess with her ladies passed by and heard the tune she stopped and looked quite pleased for she also could play it in fact it was the only tune she could play and she played it with one finger .,joy
"that is the tune i know "" she exclaimed .",joy
"god forbid "" said the lady .",anger
"it is very naughty "" said the princess and walked off .",anger
"that is tiresome "" said the princess .",anger
that was a pleasure !,joy
the ladies danced and clapped their hands for joy .,joy
"but that is superbe "" said the princess passing by .",joy
i have never heard a more beautiful composition .,joy
"i believe he is mad "" said the princess and walked off but soon she stopped .",anger
"but we do not like to kiss him "" said the ladies .",anger
the ladies of the court are up to some mischief i think .,anger
"what does this mean ? "" he said when he saw that his daughter was kissing the swineherd and then hit their heads with his shoe just as the swineherd received the sixty eighth kiss .",surprise
"go out of my sight "" said the emperor for he was very angry; and both the princess and the swineherd were banished from the empire .",anger
there she stood and cried the swineherd scolded her and the rain came down in torrents .,sadness
"alas unfortunate creature that i am ! "" said the princess "" i wish i had accepted the prince .",sadness
oh how wretched i am !,sadness
"i have now learnt to despise you "" he said .",anger
you refused an honest prince; you did not appreciate the rose and the nightingale; but you did not mind kissing a swineherd for his toys; you have no one but yourself to blame !,anger
fortunately she scrambled out of the bucket; but she fell into the water with a terrible flop and had to lie sick for three days with pains in her back .,sadness
"she ' s thick and fat and ugly "" said the young green frogs; "" and her children will be just as ugly as she is .",anger
the young frogs listened and stared; and as these words did not please them they made grimaces and dived down under the water .,anger
"oh it is such a splendid and precious thing that i cannot describe it "" said the mother toad .",joy
"quack ! "" said the little toad; and that ' s just as if one of us were to say "" aha !",anger
"ugh you beast ! "" said the farm laborer who emptied the bucket when he saw the toad .",anger
you ' re the ugliest thing i ' ve seen for one while .,anger
it ' s much nicer here than down in the well !,joy
"i should like to stay here my whole life long ! "" said the little toad .",joy
it ' s almost too much of a good thing here; it tickles one so .,joy
it ' s a glorious thing to live ! glorious to get out of the well and to lie among the stinging nettles and to crawl along the dusty road .,joy
"it will be too damp for you here "" said the frogs; "" but you are very welcome !",joy
but it doesn ' t matter; you are equally welcome .,joy
i must get higher yet; i feel a great restlessness and longing .,anger
how great it is ! how bright it is !,surprise
oh how it seems to shine in my head !,surprise
but i haven ' t the jewel; not that i cry about that no i must go higher up into splendor and joy !,joy
onward therefore straight onward !,joy
what a number of different creatures there are that i never knew ! and how beautiful and great the world is !,surprise
how green it is here ! how beautiful it is here !,surprise
it hides half the world from me but i don ' t care for the world .,anger
"it doesn ' t do that with a good will "" thought the fowl and lifted up her head to peck at the caterpillar .",anger
"aha it has allies "" quoth the fowl .",surprise
just look at the crawling thing !,anger
i don ' t care for the little green morsel; it would only tickle my throat .,anger
"i writhed myself free "" said the caterpillar .",joy
what a good thing it is when one has presence of mind !,joy
and the little toad came up and expressed her sympathy .,sadness
she was glad that in her ugliness she had frightened the fowls .,joy
nothing is so beautiful as property .,joy
"yes higher up "" said the little toad; "" higher up !",joy
"how high up they live ! "" thought the toad .",surprise
if one could only get as high as that !,surprise
"but it ' s so wonderfully ugly "" persisted the first .",joy
"a jewel ! "" cried the naturalist .",surprise
what a good thing that i have not got it !,joy
"man is the most conceited creature ! "" said the stork .",anger
listen how their jaws are wagging; and for all that they can ' t clap properly .,anger
they boast of their gifts of eloquence and their language !,anger
it makes my beak turn cold when i think of it .,anger
the world could get on without men .,anger
what a great man that is yonder ! and how high he sits !,surprise
"higher than ever i saw any one sit yet; and how he can swim ! "" she cried as the stork soared away through the air with outspread pinions .",surprise
"i must go to egypt ! "" said she .",joy
if the stork or one of his young ones would only take me !,joy
yes i shall get to egypt for i feel so happy !,joy
all the longing and all the pleasure that i feel is much better than having a jewel in one ' s head .,joy
the stork ' s beak pinched her and the wind whistled; it was not exactly agreeable but she was going upward upward towards egypt and she knew it; and that was why her eyes gleamed and a spark seemed to fly out of them .,joy
quunk ! ah !,surprise
waldemar daa remained for a time silent and thoughtful .,sadness
"his daughters wept; all the people in the mansion wiped their eyes but lady daa had driven away and i drove away too "" said the wind .",sadness
far in the interior of the wood where a noisy swarm of laborers were working stood waldemar daa and his three daughters and all were laughing at the wild cries of the birds excepting one the youngest anna dorothea who felt grieved to the heart; and when they made preparations to fell a tree that was almost dead and on whose naked branches the black stork had built her nest she saw the poor little things stretching out their necks and she begged for mercy for them with the tears in her eyes .,sadness
' leave it alone ' i sang down the chimney; ' leave it alone it will all end in smoke air coals and ashes and you will burn your fingers . ',anger
but waldemar daa did not leave it alone and all he possessed vanished like smoke blown by me .,anger
' where the chimney smokes the meal is being cooked ' says the proverb; but here a chimney smoked that devoured all the meals for the sake of gold .,anger
' give it up give it up ! ',anger
but my lord daa would not do that .,anger
the master of the castle had watched through the night in feverish excitement and had been melting and cooling distilling and mixing .,joy
i heard him sighing like a soul in despair; i heard him praying and i noticed how he held his breath .,sadness
' look at the alchymic glass ' he cried; ' something glows in the crucible pure and heavy . ',surprise
he lifted it with a trembling hand and exclaimed in a voice of agitation ' gold ! gold ! ',surprise
"he was quite giddy i could have blown him down "" said the wind; "" but i only fanned the glowing coals and accompanied him through the door to the room where his daughter sat shivering .",joy
' found ! found !,joy
gold ! gold ! ' he shouted again holding the glass aloft that it might flash in the sunshine; but his hand trembled and the alchymic glass fell from it clattering to the ground and brake in a thousand pieces .,joy
ida and anna dorothea wept bitterly joanna stood pale and proud biting her lips till the blood came; but what could that avail ?,sadness
daa and his daughters could not help hearing it so i blew about their ears to drown the noise; what use was it that they should listen ?,anger
' o h o h ' she sighed; for people can sigh like the moaning of the wind among the reeds and rushes .,sadness
' o h o h ' she would say ' no bell sounded at thy burial waldemar daa .,sadness
i suppose he is under the ground now; and ida alas ! alas ! it is not ended yet; miserable that i am !,sadness
kind heaven grant me that i may die . ',sadness
her eyes were glazing and her heart breaking; but so it would have been even had the sun not shone that morning on anna dorothea .,sadness
all passed away passed away !,surprise
"thank you old witch "" said the soldier .",joy
very well; i promise .,joy
"ah ! "" there sat the dog with the eyes as large as teacups staring at him .",surprise
good gracious what a quantity of gold there was ! enough to buy all the sugar sticks of the sweet stuff women; all the tin soldiers whips and rocking horses in the world or even the whole town itself there was indeed an immense quantity .,surprise
"that is nothing to you "" replied the witch; "" you have the money now give me the tinder box .",anger
"i tell you what "" said the soldier "" if you don ' t tell me what you are going to do with it i will draw my sword and cut off your head .",anger
"no "" said the witch .",anger
the soldier immediately cut off her head and there she lay on the ground .,surprise
no one but the king himself can pass in or out for there has been a prophecy that she will marry a common soldier and the king cannot bear to think of such a marriage .,sadness
however he passed a very pleasant time; went to the theatre drove in the king ' s garden and gave a great deal of money to the poor which was very good of him; he remembered what it had been in olden times to be without a shilling .,joy
now he was rich had fine clothes and many friends who all declared he was a fine fellow and a real gentleman and all this gratified him exceedingly .,joy
"he found the tinder box but no sooner had he struck a few sparks from the flint and steel than the door flew open and the dog with eyes as big as teacups whom he had seen while down in the tree stood before him and said "" what orders master ?",surprise
"hallo "" said the soldier; "" well this is a pleasant tinderbox if it brings me all i wish for .",joy
the dog disappeared instantly and before the soldier could even look round he returned with the princess .,surprise
then the dog ran back with the princess; but in the morning while at breakfast with the king and queen she told them what a singular dream she had had during the night of a dog and a soldier that she had ridden on the dog ' s back and been kissed by the soldier .,surprise
the soldier longed very much to see the princess once more so he sent for the dog again in the night to fetch her and to run with her as fast as ever he could .,sadness
"and here is one and there is another ! "" they all exclaimed; for there were crosses on all the doors in every direction .",surprise
so they felt it would be useless to search any farther .,anger
during the night the dog came again and carried the princess on his back and ran with her to the soldier who loved her very much and wished that he had been a prince so that he might have her for a wife .,joy
therefore in the morning the king and queen found out where their daughter had been and the soldier was taken up and put in prison .,surprise
"oh how dark and disagreeable it was as he sat there and the people said to him "" to morrow you will be hanged .",sadness
the shoemaker ' s boy liked the idea of getting the four shillings so he ran very fast and fetched the tinder box and gave it to the soldier .,joy
"i will not be touched "" said the king .",anger
the princess came out of the copper castle and became queen which was very pleasing to her .,joy
"the first thing in the world they ever heard were the words "" tin soldiers ! "" uttered by a little boy who clapped his hands with delight when the lid of the box in which they lay was taken off .",joy
still i must try and make her acquaintance .,joy
the nut crackers played at leap frog and the pencil jumped about the table .,joy
"tin soldier "" said the goblin "" don ' t wish for what does not belong to you .",anger
"very well; wait till to morrow then "" said the goblin .",anger
"when it was over two boys happened to pass by and one of them said "" look there is a tin soldier .",surprise
so they made a boat out of a newspaper and placed the tin soldier in it and sent him sailing down the gutter while the two boys ran by the side of it and clapped their hands .,joy
it touched the tin soldier so much to see her that he almost wept tin tears but he kept them back .,joy
but the ball which wore a dress of morocco leather and thought as much of herself as any other young lady would not even condescend to reply .,anger
"look at me "" said the top to the ball .",joy
no one could be happier than we should be .,joy
every time i fly up in the air he puts his head out of the nest and says ' will you ? ' and i have said ' yes ' to myself silently and that is as good as being half engaged; but i will promise never to forget you .,joy
"much good that will be to me "" said the top; and they spoke to each other no more .",anger
but the ninth time it rose in the air it remained away and did not return .,surprise
the boy searched everywhere for it but he searched in vain for it could not be found; it was gone .,sadness
"i know very well where she is "" sighed the top; "" she is in the swallow ' s nest and has married the swallow .",sadness
the more the top thought of this the more he longed for the ball .,sadness
"now i am in a nice place "" said he; "" my gilding will soon be washed off here .",joy
oh dear what a set of rabble i have got amongst !,surprise
"thank goodness here comes one of my own class with whom i can talk "" said the ball examining the gilded top .",surprise
"ah "" she exclaimed "" here is a gilt top .",surprise
in this snug retreat sat a duck on her nest watching for her young brood to hatch; she was beginning to get tired of her task for the little ones were a long time coming out of their shells and she seldom had any visitors .,sadness
"how large the world is "" said the young ducks when they found how much more room they now had than while they were inside the egg shell .",joy
"i wonder how long this is to last i am quite tired of it; "" and she seated herself again on the nest .",sadness
"one egg is not hatched yet "" said the duck "" it will not break .",anger
but just look at all the others are they not the prettiest little ducklings you ever saw ?,joy
it was very large and ugly .,surprise
"the duck stared at it and exclaimed "" it is very large and not at all like the others .",surprise
"oh "" said the mother "" that is not a turkey; how well he uses his legs and how upright he holds himself !",surprise
"see children that is the way of the world "" said the mother duck whetting her beak for she would have liked the eel ' s head herself .",sadness
"the ducklings did as they were bid but the other duck stared and said "" look here comes another brood as if there were not enough of us already ! and what a queer looking object one of them is; we don ' t want him here "" and then one flew out and bit him in the neck .",anger
"yes but he is so big and ugly "" said the spiteful duck "" and therefore he must be turned out .",anger
"the others are very pretty children "" said the old duck with the rag on her leg "" all but that one; i wish his mother could improve him a little .",anger
"that is impossible your grace "" replied the mother; "" he is not pretty; but he has a very good disposition and swims as well or even better than the others .",anger
"he is too big "" they all said and the turkey cock who had been born into the world with spurs and fancied himself really an emperor puffed himself out like a vessel in full sail and flew at the duckling and became quite red in the head with passion so that the poor little thing did not know where to go and was quite miserable because he was so ugly and laughed at by the whole farmyard .",sadness
"the poor duckling was driven about by every one; even his brothers and sisters were unkind to him and would say "" ah you ugly creature i wish the cat would get you "" and his mother said she wished he had never been born .",anger
"they are afraid of me because i am ugly "" he said .",sadness
here he remained the whole night feeling very tired and sorrowful .,sadness
"you are exceedingly ugly "" said the wild ducks "" but that will not matter if you do not want to marry one of our family .",surprise
after he had been on the moor two days there came two wild geese or rather goslings for they had not been out of the egg long and were very saucy .,joy
"listen friend "" said one of them to the duckling "" you are so ugly that we like you very well .",joy
"pop pop "" sounded in the air and the two wild geese fell dead among the rushes and the water was tinged with blood .",surprise
"he thrust his nose close to the duckling showing his sharp teeth and then "" splash splash "" he went into the water without touching him "" oh "" sighed the duckling "" how thankful i am for being so ugly; even a dog will not bite me .",joy
she laid good eggs and her mistress loved her as if she had been her own child .,joy
"oh what a prize ! "" she exclaimed "" i hope it is not a drake for then i shall have some duck ' s eggs .",surprise
then you have no right to express an opinion when sensible people are speaking .,anger
so the duckling sat in a corner feeling very low spirited till the sunshine and the fresh air came into the room through the open door and then he began to feel such a great longing for a swim on the water that he could not help telling the hen .,sadness
"what an absurd idea "" said the hen .",anger
you have nothing else to do therefore you have foolish fancies .,anger
"but it is so delightful to swim about on the water "" said the duckling "" and so refreshing to feel it close over your head while you dive down to the bottom .",joy
"delightful indeed ! "" said the hen "" why you must be crazy !",anger
don ' t imagine such nonsense child and thank your good fortune that you have been received here .,anger
but you are a chatterer and your company is not very agreeable .,anger
all this was very sad for the poor little duckling .,sadness
the duckling had never seen any like them before .,surprise
as they mounted higher and higher in the air the ugly little duckling felt quite a strange sensation as he watched them .,surprise
could he ever forget those beautiful happy birds; and when at last they were out of his sight he dived under the water and rose again almost beside himself with excitement .,joy
he became exhausted at last and lay still and helpless frozen fast in the ice .,surprise
the woman screamed and struck at him with the tongs; the children laughed and screamed and tumbled over each other in their efforts to catch him; but luckily he escaped .,anger
the door stood open; the poor creature could just manage to slip out among the bushes and lie down quite exhausted in the newly fallen snow .,sadness
it would be very sad were i to relate all the misery and privations which the poor little duckling endured during the hard winter; but when it had passed he found himself lying one morning in a moor amongst the rushes .,sadness
the duckling remembered the lovely birds and felt more strangely unhappy than ever .,sadness
"i will fly to those royal birds "" he exclaimed "" and they will kill me because i am so ugly and dare to approach them; but it does not matter : better be killed by them than pecked by the ducks beaten by the hens pushed about by the maiden who feeds the poultry or starved with hunger in the winter .",sadness
the moment they espied the stranger they rushed to meet him with outstretched wings .,joy
"kill me "" said the poor bird; and he bent his head down to the surface of the water and awaited death .",sadness
his own image; no longer a dark gray bird ugly and disagreeable to look at but a graceful and beautiful swan .,surprise
he now felt glad at having suffered sorrow and trouble because it enabled him to enjoy so much better all the pleasure and happiness around him; for the great swans swam round the new comer and stroked his neck with their beaks as a welcome .,joy
"see "" cried the youngest "" there is a new one; "" and the rest were delighted and ran to their father and mother dancing and clapping their hands and shouting joyously "" there is another swan come; a new one has arrived .",joy
"then they threw more bread and cake into the water and said "" the new one is the most beautiful of all; he is so young and pretty .",joy
then he felt quite ashamed and hid his head under his wing; for he did not know what to do he was so happy and yet not at all proud .,joy
"then he rustled his feathers curved his slender neck and cried joyfully from the depths of his heart "" i never dreamed of such happiness as this while i was an ugly duckling .",joy
there lived once upon a time a wicked prince whose heart and mind were set upon conquering all the countries of the world and on frightening the people; he devastated their countries with fire and sword and his soldiers trod down the crops in the fields and destroyed the peasants ' huts by fire so that the flames licked the green leaves off the branches and the fruit hung dried up on the singed black trees .,surprise
many a poor mother fled her naked baby in her arms behind the still smoking walls of her cottage; but also there the soldiers followed her and when they found her she served as new nourishment to their diabolical enjoyments; demons could not possibly have done worse things than these soldiers !,surprise
the prince was of opinion that all this was right and that it was only the natural course which things ought to take .,joy
"he erected magnificent palaces churches and halls and all who saw these splendid buildings and great treasures exclaimed admiringly : "" what a mighty prince !",surprise
but they did not know what endless misery he had brought upon other countries nor did they hear the sighs and lamentations which rose up from the debris of the destroyed cities .,sadness
"the prince often looked with delight upon his gold and his magnificent edifices and thought like the crowd : "" what a mighty prince !",joy
no power on earth must equal mine far less exceed it .,joy
the conquered kings were chained up with golden fetters to his chariot when he drove through the streets of his city .,surprise
these kings had to kneel at his and his courtiers ' feet when they sat at table and live on the morsels which they left .,sadness
"at last the prince had his own statue erected on the public places and fixed on the royal palaces; nay he even wished it to be placed in the churches on the altars but in this the priests opposed him saying : "" prince you are mighty indeed but god ' s power is much greater than yours; we dare not obey your orders .",anger
then i will conquer god too .,anger
"i will conquer god ! "" said the prince .",anger
i have sworn it : my will must be done !,anger
they buzzed round the prince and stung his face and hands; angrily he drew his sword and brandished it but he only touched the air and did not hit the gnats .,anger
mad with pain he tore off the coverings and his clothes too flinging them far away and danced about before the eyes of his ferocious soldiers who now mocked at him the mad prince who wished to make war with god and was overcome by a single little gnat .,anger
"i cannot bear "" said he "" to see them going out at the door carrying their little parcels .",anger
"on the contrary they would go nowhere "" replied ginger gloomily .",sadness
"i have tried in vain to get a license upon credit at the post office; "" said pickles .",sadness
and i feel sure that anna maria pockets things,anger
pickles nearly had a fit he barked and he barked and made little rushes .,anger
"bite him pickles ! bite him ! "" spluttered ginger behind a sugar barrel "" he ' s only a german doll !",anger
pickles barked till he was hoarse .,anger
"this is the last straw "" said pickles "" let us close the shop .",anger
"so everybody was pleased when sally henny penny sent out a printed poster to say that she was going to reopen the shop "" henny ' s opening sale !",joy
sally henny penny gets rather flustered when she tries to count out change and she insists on being paid cash; but she is quite harmless .,anger
there is something to please everybody .,joy

"butter and dough "" replied anna maria .",anger
anna maria said she thought that it was of no consequence; but she wished that tom kitten would hold his head still as it disarranged the pastry .,anger
tom kitten bit and spit and mewed and wriggled; and the rolling pin went roly poly roly; roly poly roly .,anger
his tail is sticking out !,anger
you did not fetch enough dough anna maria .,anger

"i do not think "" said samuel whiskers pausing to take a look at tom kitten "" i do not think it will be a good pudding .",anger

anna maria was about to argue the point when all at once there began to be other sounds up above the rasping noise of a saw and the noise of a little dog scratching and yelping !,surprise
the rats dropped the rolling pin and listened attentively .,surprise
i fear that we shall be obliged to leave this pudding .,sadness
but i am persuaded that the knots would have proved indigestible whatever you may urge to the contrary .,anger

"so old mr . bouncer laughed; and pressed tommy brock to come inside to taste a slice of seed cake and "" a glass of my daughter flopsy ' s cowslip wine .",joy
then old mr . bouncer smoked another pipe and gave tommy brock a cabbage leaf cigar which was so very strong that it made tommy brock grin more than ever; and the smoke filled the burrow .,joy
old mr . bouncer coughed and laughed; and tommy brock puffed and grinned .,joy

the young family were alive; shut up in the oven !,surprise
benjamin was so excited that it was a mercy he did not awake tommy brock whose snores continued solemnly in mr . tod ' s bed .,joy
again from the fields down below in the mist there came the angry cry of a jay followed by the sharp yelping bark of a fox !,surprise
mr . tod was coming up bull banks and he was in the very worst of tempers .,anger
first he had been upset by breaking the plate .,anger
then the midges had been very bad .,anger
and he had failed to catch a hen pheasant on her nest; and it had contained only five eggs two of them addled .,anger
mr . tod had had an unsatisfactory night .,anger
as usual when out of humor he determined to move house .,anger
he made his way up the hill; his temper was not improved by noticing unmistakable marks of badger .,anger
mr . tod slapped his stick upon the earth and fumed; he guessed where tommy brock had gone to .,anger
he was further annoyed by the jay bird which followed him persistently .,anger
once when it flew screaming over his head mr . tod snapped at it and barked .,anger
the sight that met mr . tod ' s eyes in mr . tod ' s kitchen made mr . tod furious .,anger
his whiskers bristled and his coat collar stood on end with rage .,anger
when he was outside the house he scratched up the earth with fury .,anger
he was an incurably indolent person; he was not in the least afraid of mr . tod; he was simply too lazy and comfortable to move .,anger
it creaked; he turned round with a jump .,surprise
tommy brock opened both eyes and looked at the rope and grinned .,joy
he was puzzled .,surprise
"i will wake him up with an unpleasant surprise "" said mr . tod .",joy
the moment he had gone tommy brock got up in a hurry; he rolled mr . tod ' s dressing gown into a bundle put it into the bed beneath the pail of water instead of himself and left the room also grinning immensely .,joy
at last the rope gave way with such a sudden jerk that it nearly pulled his teeth out and quite knocked him over backwards .,surprise
mr . tod was mystified; he sat quite still and listened attentively .,surprise
yes there was no doubt about it it had turned out even better than he had planned; the pail had hit poor old tommy brock and killed him dead !,joy
i will bury that nasty person in the hole which he has dug .,joy
i must have a disinfecting .,anger
he was quite dry himself and grinning; and he threw the cup of scalding tea all over mr . tod .,joy
then mr . tod rushed upon tommy brock and tommy brock grappled with mr . tod amongst the broken crockery and there was a terrific battle all over the kitchen .,anger
when the kettle fell tommy brock who was still grinning happened to be uppermost; and he rolled mr . tod over and over like a log out at the door .,joy
then the snarling and worrying went on outside; and they rolled over the bank and down hill bumping over the rocks .,anger
there will never be any love lost between tommy brock and mr . tod .,anger
now for it !,joy
run in cousin benjamin !,joy
run in and get them ! while i watch the door .,joy
at home in the rabbit hole things had not been quite comfortable .,anger
after quarreling at supper flopsy and old mr . bouncer had passed a sleepless night and quarrelled again at breakfast .,anger
old mr . bouncer could no longer deny that he had invited company into the rabbit hole; but he refused to reply to the questions and reproaches of flopsy .,anger
old mr . bouncer very sulky was huddled up in a corner barricaded with a chair .,anger
i ' ve got them !,joy
great was old mr . bouncer ' s relief and flopsy ' s joy when peter and benjamin arrived in triumph with the young family .,joy
the rabbit babies were rather tumbled and very hungry; they were fed and put to bed .,sadness
he was rather upon his dignity; but he accepted .,joy
old mr . bouncer was forgiven and they all had dinner .,joy
and then feeling rather sick he went to look for some parsley .,sadness
but round the end of a cucumber frame whom should he meet but mr . mcgregor !,surprise
"mr . mcgregor was on his hands and knees planting out young cabbages but he jumped up and ran after peter waving a rake and calling out "" stop thief .",anger
peter gave himself up for lost and shed big tears; but his sobs were overheard by some friendly sparrows who flew to him in great excitement and implored him to exert himself .,sadness
peter began to cry .,sadness
then he tried to find his way straight across the garden but he became more and more puzzled .,sadness
he went back towards the toolshed but suddenly quite close to him he heard the noise of a hoe scr r ritch scratch scratch scritch .,surprise
he slipped underneath the gate and was safe at last in the wood outside the garden .,surprise
it was the second little jacket and pair of shoes that peter had lost in a fortnight !,surprise
i am sorry to say that peter was not very well during the evening .,sadness
"the eight little pigs had very fine appetites "" yus yus yus ! they eat and indeed they do eat ! "" said aunt pettitoes looking at her family with pride .",joy

cross patch tried to bite me .,anger
"yus yus ! "" sighed aunt pettitoes .",anger
"yus yus yus "" said aunt pettitoes "" there will be more to eat without them .",sadness
aunt pettitoes wiped her eyes with a large pocket handkerchief then she wiped pigling bland ' s nose and shed tears; then she wiped alexander ' s nose and shed tears; then she passed the handkerchief to spot .,sadness
aunt pettitoes sighed and grunted and addressed those little pigs as follows,sadness
pigling bland who was a sedate little pig looked solemnly at his mother a tear trickled down his cheek .,sadness
"aunt pettitoes turned to the other "" now son alexander take the hand "" "" wee wee wee ! "" giggled alexander "" take the hand of your brother pigling bland you must go to market .",joy
pigling bland listened gravely; alexander was hopelessly volatile .,sadness
he danced about and pinched his brother singing,joy
"this pig went to market this pig stayed at home "" this pig had a bit of meat",joy
alexander went into squeals of laughter .,joy
then he pricked pigling with the pin that had fastened his pig paper; and when pigling slapped him he dropped the pin and tried to take pigling ' s pin and the papers got mixed up .,anger
pigling bland reproved alexander .,anger
but presently they made it up again and trotted away together singing,joy
"to 2 1/2 oz . conversation sweeties at three farthings "" "" what ' s this ? this ain ' t a license ?",surprise
to conclude the adventures of alexander the policeman sauntered up to the house about tea time followed by a damp subdued little pig .,sadness
"pigling bland went on alone dejectedly; he came to cross roads and a sign post "" to market town 5 miles "" "" over the hills 4 miles "" "" to pettitoes farm 3 miles .",sadness
pigling bland was shocked there was little hope of sleeping in market town and tomorrow was the hiring fair; it was deplorable to think how much time had been wasted by the frivolity of alexander .,surprise
he had never wanted to go; and the idea of standing all by himself in a crowded market to be stared at pushed and hired by some big strange farmer was very disagreeable,anger
he put his cold hand in his pocket and felt his paper he put his other hand in his other pocket and felt another paper alexander ' s !,surprise
pigling squealed; then ran back frantically hoping to overtake alexander and the policeman .,surprise
"he saw a small wooden hut made his way to it and crept inside "" i am afraid it is a hen house but what can i do ? "" said pigling bland wet and cold and quite tired out .",sadness

he looked up blinking and saw an offensively ugly elderly man grinning from ear to ear .,joy
"there was a smothered noise "" shut up ! "" said mr . piperson .",anger
"mr . piperson pulled off the other boot and flung it after the first there was again a curious noise "" be quiet will ye ? "" said mr . piperson .",anger
"mr . piperson hurried out with the hamper enjoining pigling to shut the door behind him and not meddle with nought; or "" i ' ll come back and skin ye ! "" said mr . piperson .",anger
pigling bland put down a plate which he was wiping and listened .,surprise
pigling bland jumped and looked round .,surprise
a perfectly lovely little black berkshire pig stood smiling beside him .,joy
"bacon hams "" replied pig wig cheerfully .",joy
"why on earth don ' t you run away ? "" exclaimed the horrified pigling .",surprise
"i shall after supper "" said pig wig decidedly .",joy
pigling bland made more porridge and watched her shyly .,joy
"i might take you to the bridge; if you have no objection "" said pigling much confused and sitting on the edge of his coppy stool .",sadness
pig wig ' s gratitude was such and she asked so many questions that it became embarrassing to pigling bland .,joy
"i thought you had eaten them ? "" said pigling waking suddenly .",surprise
"i have tooth ache "" said pigling much dismayed .",sadness
she wagged her head and rocked about clapping time and singing in a sweet little grunty voice,joy
she dropped pigling ' s hand and commenced to dance singing presently .,joy
pigling bland refused quite crossly .,anger
pigling bland grunted .,anger

by degrees one after another they were overcome with slumber and lay down in the mown grass .,joy
the little flopsy bunnies slept delightfully in the warm sun .,joy
the little rabbits smiled sweetly in their sleep under the shower of grass; they did not awake because the lettuces had been so soporific .,joy

"the bear was about to set at the little fellow at once and give him a hearty welcome with his paws : "" softly softly "" said the little tailor "" i will soon make thee quiet .",anger
then quite composedly and as if he had not an anxiety in the world he took some nuts out of his pocket cracked them and ate the kernels .,joy
when the bear saw that he was seized with a desire to have some nuts too .,joy
the bear put them in his mouth but could get nothing out of them let him bite as he would .,anger
"eh ! "" thought he "" what a stupid blockhead i am !",anger
"i cannot even crack a nut ! "" and then he said to the tailor "" here crack me the nuts .",anger
"when the bear heard the music he could not help beginning to dance and when he had danced a while the thing pleased him so well that he said to the little tailor "" hark you is the fiddle heavy ?",joy
"so "" said the bear; "" fiddling is a thing i should like to understand too that i might dance whenever i had a fancy .",joy
"with all my heart "" said the tailor "" if thou hast a talent for it .",joy
"then a vise was brought and the bear put his claws in it and the little tailor screwed it tight and said "" now wait until i come with the scissors "" and he let the bear growl as he liked and lay down in the corner on a bundle of straw and fell asleep .",anger
in the morning she arose careless and happy but when she peeped into the stable the tailor stood gaily before her and was as healthy as a fish in water .,surprise
when they had got into the carriage the two other tailors who had false hearts and envied him his good fortune went into the stable and unscrewed the bear again .,anger
the bear in great fury ran after the carriage .,anger
the tailor drove quietly to church and the princess was married to him at once and he lived with her as happy as a woodlark .,joy
"little brother took his little sister by the hand and said "" since our mother died we have had no happiness; our step mother beats us every day and if we come near her she kicks us away with her foot .",sadness
our meals are the hard crusts of bread that are left over; and the little dog under the table is better off for she often throws it a nice bit .,sadness
may heaven pity us .,sadness
if our mother only knew !,sadness
"they walked the whole day over meadows fields and stony places; and when it rained the little sister said "" heaven and our hearts are weeping together .",sadness
in the evening they came to a large forest and they were so weary with sorrow and hunger and the long walk that they lay down in a hollow tree and fell asleep .,sadness
"the brother did not drink and said "" i will wait until we come to the next spring but then i must drink say what you like; for my thirst is too great .",anger
and now the sister wept over her poor bewitched brother and the little roe wept also and sat sorrowfully near to her .,sadness
then she sought for leaves and moss to make a soft bed for the roe; and every morning she went out and gathered roots and berries and nuts for herself and brought tender grass for the roe who ate out of her hand and was content and played round about her .,joy
then the blasts of the horns the barking of dogs and the merry shouts of the huntsmen rang through the trees and the roebuck heard all and was only too anxious to be there .,surprise
"oh "" said he to his sister "" let me be off to the hunt i cannot bear it any longer; "" and he begged so much that at last she agreed .",sadness
then the young roebuck sprang away; so happy was he and so merry in the open air .,joy
"the next day the hunt went on afresh and when the roebuck again heard the bugle horn and the ho ! ho ! of the huntsmen he had no peace but said "" sister let me out i must be off .",joy
"then you will have me die of grief "" answered the roe; "" when i hear the bugle horns i feel as if i must jump out of my skin .",anger
then the door opened and the king walked in and there stood a maiden more lovely than any he had ever seen .,surprise
"but the king looked kindly at her stretched out his hand and said "" will you go with me to my palace and be my dear wife ?",joy
"yes indeed "" answered the maiden "" but the little roe must go with me i cannot leave him .",joy
she was now the queen and they lived for a long time happily together; the roebuck was tended and cherished and ran about in the palace garden .,joy
now when she heard that they were so happy and so well off envy and hatred rose in her heart and left her no peace and she thought of nothing but how she could bring them again to misfortune .,anger
"her own daughter who was ugly as night and had only one eye grumbled at her and said "" a queen ! that ought to have been my luck .",anger
"only be quiet "" answered the old woman and comforted her by saying "" when the time comes i shall be ready .",anger
in the evening when he came home and heard that he had a son he was heartily glad and was going to the bed of his dear wife to see how she was .,joy
"the king said "" ah heavens ! what is this ?",surprise
"then the king could not restrain himself; he sprang towards her and said "" you can be none other than my dear wife .",surprise
"she answered "" yes i am your dear wife "" and at the same moment she received life again and by god "" s grace became fresh rosy and full of health .",joy
and as soon as she was burnt the roebuck changed his shape and received his human form again so the sister and brother lived happily together all their lives .,joy
the woman became bitterly unkind to her step daughter and day by day did her best to treat her still worse .,anger
she was also envious because her step daughter was beautiful and lovable and her own daughter ugly and repulsive .,anger
"good heavens ! "" said the girl "" no strawberries grow in winter !",surprise
and why am i to go in this paper frock ?,surprise
"it is so cold outside that one "" s very breath freezes !",surprise
the wind will blow through the frock and the thorns will tear it off my body .,surprise
"wilt thou contradict me again ? "" said the stepmother "" see that thou goest and do not show thy face again until thou hast the basketful of strawberries !",anger
"then she gave her a little piece of hard bread and said "" this will last thee the day "" and thought "" thou wilt die of cold and hunger outside and wilt never be seen again by me .",anger
"they asked "" what dost thou here in the forest in the winter time in thy thin dress ?",surprise
"then said the first "" my gift is that she shall every day grow more beautiful .",joy
"the second said "" my gift is that gold pieces shall fall out of her mouth every time she speaks .",joy
"the third said "" my gift is that a king shall come and take her to wife .",joy
the girl however did as the little men had bidden her swept away the snow behind the little house with the broom and what did she find but real ripe strawberries which came up quite dark red out of the snow !,surprise
in her joy she hastily gathered her basket full thanked the little men shook hands with each of them and ran home to take her step mother what she had longed for so much .,joy
"now look at her arrogance "" cried the step sister "" to throw about gold in that way ! "" but she was secretly envious of it and wanted to go into the forest also to seek strawberries .",anger
"give us some of it "" cried the little men; but she replied "" there is not enough for myself so how can i give it away to other people ?",anger
humph !,anger
"sweep for yourselves "" she answered "" i am not your servant .",anger
"the first said "" i grant that she may grow uglier every day .",anger
"the second said "" i grant that at every word she says a toad shall spring out of her mouth .",anger
"the third said "" i grant that she may die a miserable death .",anger
the maiden looked for strawberries outside but as she found none she went angrily home .,anger
and when she opened her mouth and was about to tell her mother what had happened to her in the wood with every word she said a toad sprang out of her mouth so that every one was seized with horror of her .,surprise
"then the step mother was still more enraged and thought of nothing but how to do every possible injury to the man "" s daughter whose beauty however grew daily greater .",anger
"ah yes with all my heart "" she answered for she was glad to get away from the mother and sister .",joy
so she got into the carriage and drove away with the king and when they arrived at his palace the wedding was celebrated with great pomp as the little men had granted to the maiden .,joy
thereupon the king was full of great joy but he kept the queen hidden in a chamber until the sunday when the baby was to be christened .,joy
night fell and nothing was left for him to do but to seek a bed in this painful solitude .,sadness
he sought out a high oak climbed up to the top of it and thanked god that he had his goose with him for otherwise the wind which blew over the top of the tree would have carried him away .,joy
he knocked boldly the door opened and by the light which came forth he saw a little hoary old man who wore a coat made of bits of colored stuff sewn together .,joy
"who are you and what do you want ? "" asked the man in a grumbling voice .",anger
"i am a poor tailor "" he answered "" whom night has surprised here in the wilderness and i earnestly beg you to take me into your hut until morning .",surprise
"go your way "" replied the old man in a surly voice "" i will have nothing to do with runagates; seek for yourself a shelter elsewhere .",anger
after these words he was about to slip into his hut again but the tailor held him so tightly by the corner of his coat and pleaded so piteously that the old man who was not so ill natured as he wished to appear was at last softened and took him into the hut with him where he gave him something to eat and then pointed out to him a very good bed in a corner .,sadness
the weary tailor needed no rocking; but slept sweetly till morning but even then would not have thought of getting up if he had not been aroused by a great noise .,surprise
they rushed at each other with such extreme rage that the ground shook with their trampling and the air resounded with their cries .,anger
the tailor who had watched the fight with astonishment was still standing there motionless when the stag in full career bounded up to him and before he could escape caught him up on his great horns .,surprise
he held with both hands to the tops of the horns and resigned himself to his fate .,sadness
flames of fire shot forth after which followed a great smoke which hid the stag from his sight .,surprise
"he looked at everything full of admiration and was on the point of going out again when he once more heard the voice which said to him "" step on the stone which lies in the middle of the hall and great good fortune awaits thee .",joy
on the floor of the hall two great glass chests stood opposite to each other which at once excited his curiosity .,surprise
how his admiration increased when he saw therein a maiden of the greatest beauty !,joy
the tailor was looking at the beauty with beating heart when she suddenly opened her eyes and started up at the sight of him in joyful terror .,joy
"just heaven ! "" cried she "" my deliverance is at hand !",surprise
quick quick help me out of my prison; if thou pushest back the bolt of this glass coffin then i shall be free .,joy
"then she seated herself on a stone ordered the young man to come to her and after she had imprinted a friendly kiss on his lips she said "" my long desired deliverer kind heaven has guided thee to me and put an end to my sorrows .",joy
thou art the husband chosen for me by heaven and shalt pass thy life in unbroken joy loved by me and rich to overflowing in every earthly possession .,joy
we loved each other so tenderly and were so alike in our way of thinking and our inclinations that we both embraced the resolution never to marry but to stay together to the end of our lives .,joy
my brother liked the stranger so much that he begged him to spend a couple of days with us to which after some hesitation he consented .,joy
we did not rise from table until late in the night the stranger was shown to room and i hastened as i was tired to lay my limbs in my soft bed .,sadness
hardly had i slept for a short time when the sound of faint and delightful music awoke me .,surprise
as i could not conceive from whence it came i wanted to summon my waiting maid who slept in the next room but to my astonishment i found that speech was taken away from me by an unknown force .,surprise
my repugnance to his magic arts was however so great that i vouchsafed him no answer .,anger
i asked him where he had left my brother and how he had come by this stag out of whose great eyes i saw tears flowing .,sadness
"i fell into a great rage at this pulled out a pistol and discharged it at the monster; but the ball rebounded from his breast and went into my horse "" s head .",anger
when i came to my senses again i found myself in this underground cave in a glass coffin .,surprise
amongst the visions which passed before my eyes that was the most comforting in which a young man came and set me free and when i opened my eyes to day i saw thee and beheld my dream fulfilled .,joy
the maiden had scarcely opened the bottles when the blue smoke rushed out and changed itself into living men in whom she recognized her servants and her people .,surprise
her joy was still more increased when her brother who had killed the magician in the form of the bull came out of the forest towards them in his human form and on the self same day the maiden in accordance with her promise gave her hand at the altar to the lucky tailor .,joy
i would rather go away and see how i can earn my bread .,sadness
so the father gave him his blessing and with great sorrow took leave of him .,sadness
"and when he came before the enemy there was a battle and great danger and it rained shot until his comrades fell on all sides and when the leader also was killed those left were about to take flight but the youth stepped forth spoke boldly to them and cried "" we will not let our fatherland be ruined !",anger
when the king heard that he owed the victory to him alone he raised him above all the others gave him great treasures and made him the first in the kingdom .,joy
"but dost thou know what thou must promise ? "" said the king .",surprise
"i must be buried with her "" he replied "" if i outlive her but my love is so great that i do not mind the danger .",joy
and now he sat there full of pain and grief ate every day only a little piece of bread drank only a mouthful of wine and nevertheless saw death daily drawing nearer .,sadness
"and as he thought it came to gnaw at it he drew his sword and said "" as long as i live thou shalt not touch her "" and hewed the snake in three pieces .",anger
"thou art with me dear wife "" he answered and told her how everything had happened and how he had brought her back again to life .",joy
the king came down himself and opened the door and there he found both strong and well and rejoiced with them that now all sorrow was over .,joy
"when the shameful deed was done she said "" now let us return home and say that he died on the way .",joy
he was astonished when he saw them come alone and asked what had happened to them .,surprise
"when he learnt the wickedness of his daughter he said "" i cannot believe that she has behaved so ill but the truth will soon come to light "" and bade both go into a secret chamber and keep themselves hidden from every one .",anger
"ah dear father "" she replied "" i come home again in great grief; during the voyage my husband became suddenly ill and died and if the good skipper had not given me his help it would have gone ill with me .",sadness
he was present at his death and can tell you all .,sadness
when the woman saw her husband she was thunderstruck and fell on her knees and begged for mercy .,surprise
"the king said "" there is no mercy .",anger
he was ready to die with thee and restored thee to life again but thou hast murdered him in his sleep and shalt receive the reward that thou deservest .,anger
"oh yes "" said the girl in a sad voice "" that you certainly can but i do not advise you to venture it .",sadness
"the maiden sighed and said "" my step mother practises wicked arts; she is ill disposed toward strangers .",sadness
"good evening "" growled she and pretended to be quite friendly .",anger
the servant ran after his master and told him what had happened but would not leave his saddle behind him and ran back to fetch it .,surprise
she did not know what that was she thought and thought but she could not find out she opened her riddle books but it was not in them in short her wisdom was at an end .,surprise
but the clever servant had placed himself in the bed instead of his master and when the maid came there he tore off from her the mantle in which she had wrapped herself and chased her out with rods .,anger
"the second night the king "" s daughter sent her maid in waiting who was to see if she could succeed better in listening but the servant took her mantle also away from her and hunted her out with rods .",anger
when she knew the answer to the riddle she wanted to steal away but he held her mantle so fast that she was forced to leave it behind her .,surprise
"but the youth begged for a hearing and said "" she stole into my room in the night and questioned me otherwise she could not have discovered it .",anger
"the king who had a bad heart and was angry about the prophecy went to the parents and seeming quite friendly said "" you poor people let me have your child and i will take care of it .",anger
"the king put it in a box and rode away with it until he came to a deep piece of water; then he threw the box into it and thought "" i have freed my daughter from her unlooked for suitor .",joy
"he took him to the miller and his wife and as they had no children they were glad and said "" god has given him to us .",joy
soon afterwards the robbers came and angrily asked what strange boy was lying there ?,anger
"then the hard hearted robbers felt pity and their leader tore up the letter and wrote another saying that as soon as the boy came he should be married at once to the king "" s daughter .",sadness
"and the queen when she had received the letter and read it did as was written in it and had a splendid wedding feast prepared and the king "" s daughter was married to the luck child and as the youth was handsome and agreeable she lived with him in joy and contentment .",joy
"how has that come to pass ? "" said he; "" i gave quite another order in my letter .",surprise
"the king said in a passion "" you shall not have everything quite so much your own way; whosoever marries my daughter must fetch me from hell three golden hairs from the head of the devil; bring me what i want and you shall keep my daughter .",anger
"that is a good deal to ask for "" said she; "" if the devil comes home and finds you it will cost you your life; but as i pity you i will see if i cannot help you .",surprise
no sooner had he entered than he noticed that the air was not pure .,surprise
"i smell man "" s flesh "" said he; "" all is not right here .",anger
his grandmother scolded him .,anger
"it has just been swept "" said she "" and everything put in order and now you are upsetting it again; you have always got man "" s flesh in your nose .",anger
"oh ! "" cried the devil "" what are you doing ?",surprise
"oh ho ! if they did but know it "" answered the devil; "" there is a toad sitting under a stone in the well; if they killed it the wine would flow again .",joy
"ha ! what are you doing ? "" cried the devil angrily .",anger
"oh ! if they did but know "" answered the devil .",joy
but leave me alone with your dreams : if you disturb me in my sleep again you will get a box on the ear .,anger
"the devil jumped up roared out and would have treated her ill if she had not quieted him once more and said "" who can help bad dreams ?",anger
"what was the dream then ? "" asked he and was quite curious .",anger
"ah ! the fool "" answered the devil; "" when any one comes and wants to go across he must put the oar in his hand and the other man will have to ferry and he will be free .",joy
"yes "" answered he "" i heard and will take care to remember .",joy
he thanked the old woman for helping him in his need and left hell well content that everything had turned out so fortunately .,joy
then the watchman thanked him and gave him as a reward two asses laden with gold which followed him .,joy
the watchman thanked him and also gave him two asses laden with gold .,joy
at last the luck child got home to his wife who was heartily glad to see him again and to hear how well he had prospered in everything .,joy
"to the king he took what he had asked for the devil "" s three golden hairs and when the king saw the four asses laden with gold he was quite content and said "" now all the conditions are fulfilled and you can keep my daughter .",joy
"can i too fetch some of it ? "" said the king; and he was quite eager about it .",joy
on this the little flea began to scream loudly .,surprise

the little tree is shaking itself .,surprise
"oh ho ! "" said the spring "" then i will begin to flow "" and began to flow violently .",surprise
"honest indeed "" said peter "" like the thief on the gallows !",anger
"thou hast been light fingered and hast snipped folks "" clothes away .",anger
thou wilt not get into heaven .,anger
"come do be merciful "" cried the tailor .",sadness
look i am lame and have blisters on my feet with walking here i cannot possibly turn back again .,sadness
only let me in and i will do all the rough work .,sadness
the tailor stood still and looked at the seat for a long time for it pleased him better than all else .,joy
the sight of this made the tailor so angry that he laid hold of the golden footstool and threw it down to earth through heaven at the old thief .,anger
"oh lord "" answered the tailor joyously "" i threw it in my anger down to earth at an old woman whom i saw stealing two veils at the washing .",joy
"oh thou knave "" said the lord "" were i to judge as thou judgest how dost thou think thou couldst have escaped so long ?",anger
no one shall give punishment here but i alone the lord .,anger
"one morning the wood cutter went out sorrowfully to his work in the forest and while he was cutting wood suddenly there stood before him a tall and beautiful woman with a crown of shining stars on her head who said to him "" i am the virgin mary mother of the child jesus .",sadness
there the child fared well ate sugar cakes and drank sweet milk and her clothes were of gold and the little angels played with her .,joy
in each of them sat one of the apostles in the midst of a great light and she rejoiced in all the magnificence and splendour and the little angels who always accompanied her rejoiced with her .,joy
"oh no "" said the little angels "" that would be a sin .",anger
the virgin mary has forbidden it and it might easily cause thy unhappiness .,anger
then she was silent but the desire in her heart was not stilled but gnawed there and tormented her and let her have no rest .,anger
she stayed there awhile and looked at everything in amazement; then she touched the light a little with her finger and her finger became quite golden .,surprise
"then she said once again "" art thou certain that thou hast not done it ?",anger
"then she perceived the finger which had become golden from touching the fire of heaven and saw well that the child had sinned and said for the third time "" hast thou not done it ?",anger
"then said the virgin mary "" thou hast not obeyed me and besides that thou hast lied thou art no longer worthy to be in heaven .",anger
she wanted to cry out but she could bring forth no sound .,sadness
here too she found a shelter from storm and rain but it was a miserable life and bitterly did she weep when she remembered how happy she had been in heaven and how the angels had played with her .,sadness
thus she sat year after year and felt the pain and the misery of the world .,sadness
when he had at last forced his way through he saw a wonderfully beautiful maiden sitting under the tree; and she sat there and was entirely covered with her golden hair down to her very feet .,surprise
"he stood still and looked at her full of surprise then he spoke to her and said "" who art thou ?",surprise
although she could not speak she was still so beautiful and charming that he began to love her with all his heart and it was not long before he married her .,joy
"next morning when this child also had disappeared the people declared quite loudly that the queen had devoured it and the king "" s councillors demanded that she should be brought to justice .",anger
the king however loved her so dearly that he would not believe it and commanded the councillors under pain of death not to say any more about it .,anger
"when the queen rejoiced thereat the virgin mary said "" is thy heart not yet softened ?",joy
"she must be judged "" and the king was no longer able to restrain his councillors .",anger
"she spoke kindly to her and said "" he who repents his sin and acknowledges it is forgiven .",joy
in the anguish of his heart the king consented and the old woman led him to her little hut where her daughter was sitting by the fire .,sadness
she received the king as if she had been expecting him and he saw that she was very beautiful but still she did not please him and he could not look at her without secret horror .,anger
the children who saw from a distance that some one was approaching thought that their dear father was coming to them and full of joy ran to meet him .,joy
the queen went home quite delighted and thought she had got rid of her step children but the girl had not run out with her brothers and the queen knew nothing about her .,joy
"where are thy brothers ? "" asked the king .",surprise
"alas dear father "" she answered "" they have gone away and left me alone ! "" and she told him that she had seen from her little window how her brothers had flown away over the forest in the shape of swans and she showed him the feathers which they had let fall in the courtyard and which she had picked up .",sadness
the king mourned but he did not think that the queen had done this wicked deed and as he feared that the girl would also be stolen away from him he wanted to take her away with him .,sadness
"the poor girl thought "" i can no longer stay here .",sadness
then the maiden looked at them and recognized her brothers was glad and crept forth from beneath the bed .,joy
the brothers were not less delighted to see their little sister but their joy was of short duration .,joy
"the little sister wept and said "" can you not be set free ?",sadness
"alas no "" they answered "" the conditions are too hard !",sadness
"as she was so beautiful the king "" s heart was touched and he was smitten with a great love for her .",joy
"he placed her by his side at table and her modest bearing and courtesy pleased him so much that he said "" she is the one whom i wish to marry and no other woman in the world .",joy
the king however had a wicked mother who was dissatisfied with this marriage and spoke ill of the young queen .,anger
"who knows "" said she "" from whence the creature who can "" t speak comes ?",anger
she is not worthy of a king !,anger
then she saw that her deliverance was near and her heart leapt with joy .,joy
then to the great joy of the king they were brought thither and as a punishment the wicked step mother was bound to the stake and burnt to ashes .,joy
but the king and the queen with their six brothers lived many years in happiness and peace .,joy
the wolf had the fox with him and whatsoever the wolf wished that the fox was compelled to do for he was the weaker and he would gladly have been rid of his master .,sadness
that suited the wolf and they went thither and the fox stole the little lamb took it to the wolf and went away .,joy
the wolf devoured it but was not satisfied with one; he wanted the other as well and went to get it .,sadness
as however he did it so awkwardly the mother of the little lamb heard him and began to cry out terribly and to bleat so that the farmer came running there .,sadness
they found the wolf and beat him so mercilessly that he went to the fox limping and howling .,anger
"thou hast misled me finely "" said he; "" i wanted to fetch the other lamb and the country folks surprised me and have beaten me to a jelly .",anger
this made such a great noise that the woman came out and when she saw the wolf she called the people who hurried there and beat him as long as their sticks would hold together till with two lame legs and howling loudly he got back to the fox in the forest .,anger
"how abominably thou hast misled me ! "" cried he "" the peasants caught me and tanned my skin for me .",anger
"on the third day when they were out together and the wolf could only limp along painfully he again said "" red fox get me something to eat or i will eat thee thyself .",sadness
"there was meat in abundance and the wolf attacked it instantly and thought "" there is plenty of time before i need leave off !",joy
then came the farmer with a cudgel and struck him dead but the fox bounded into the forest glad to be rid of the old glutton .,anger
then the little cock took the water to the hen but when he got there the hen had choked in the meantime and lay there dead and motionless .,surprise
then the cock was so distressed that he cried aloud and every animal came to lament the little hen and six mice built a little carriage to carry her to her grave and when the carriage was ready they harnessed themselves to it and the cock drove .,sadness
but when the six mice came to the bridge the straw slipped and fell into the water and the six mice all fell in and were drowned .,surprise
so the coal also laid itself across the water but unhappily just touched it on which the coal hissed was extinguished and died .,sadness
when a stone saw that it took pity on the little cock wished to help him and laid itself over the water .,sadness
then the cock drew the carriage himself but when he got it over and reached the other shore with the dead hen and was about to draw over the others who were sitting behind as well there were too many of them the carriage ran back and they all fell into the water together and were drowned .,surprise
then the little cock was left alone with the dead hen and dug a grave for her and laid her in it and made a mound above it on which he sat down and fretted until he died too and then every one was dead .,sadness
when gambling hansel came however he pretended that the money had fallen into the gutter and kept raking about in it all the while to find it but our lord already knew that he had lost it in play .,anger
"our lord then inquired if he had no wine and he said "" alack sir the casks are all empty !",sadness
when he turned the tap however lo and behold the best of wine ran out !,surprise
"upon this st . peter said to the lord "" lord this thing must not go on he will win and thou lose the whole world .",anger
"so st . peter said to the lord "" lord this thing must not go on .",anger
"so hansel went at once to death and said to him "" come down "" and death took him directly and put an end to him .",surprise
ah we will have nothing to do with him !,anger
begone !,anger
and now he was off again with his crooked devils and they went to hohenfuert and pulled up a hop pole and with it went to heaven and began to thrust the pole against it and heaven began to crack .,surprise
"so again st . peter said "" lord this thing cannot go on we must let him in or he will throw us down from heaven .",anger
"therefore st . peter once more said "" lord this cannot go on we must throw him down or he will make all heaven rebellious .",anger
in olden times when the lord himself still used to walk about on this earth amongst men it once happened that he was tired and overtaken by the darkness before he could reach an inn .,sadness
"then the rich man looked at the traveler from head to foot and as the lord was wearing common clothes and did not look like one who had much money in his pocket he shook his head and said "" no i cannot take you in my rooms are full of herbs and seeds; and if i were to lodge everyone who knocked at my door i might very soon go begging myself .",anger
"pass the night with me it is already dark "" said he; "" you cannot go any further to night .",joy
this pleased the lord and he went in .,joy
"the poor man "" s wife shook hands with him and welcomed him and said he was to make himself at home and put up with what they had got; they had not much to offer him but what they had they would give him with all their hearts .",joy
when the cloth was laid the lord sat down with the man and his wife and he enjoyed their coarse food for there were happy faces at the table .,joy
"with all my heart "" he answered "" i will go and offer it to him; "" and he went to the stranger and invited him if he had no objection to sleep in their bed and rest his limbs properly .",joy
"then the man said "" what else should i wish for but eternal happiness and that we two as long as we live may be healthy and have every day our daily bread; for the third wish i do not know what to have .",joy
"oh yes "" said the man; "" if i can have that too i should like it very much .",joy
"he was very much astonished and called his wife and said to her "" tell me what can have happened ?",surprise
"the man said "" i could tear myself to pieces !",anger
if i had but known that !,anger
that traveler came to our house too and wanted to sleep here and i sent him away .,anger
the rich man had now gained what he wanted so he rode home and began to consider what he should wish for .,joy
"then at last he was angry and cried quite impatiently "" i wish your neck was broken !",anger
directly he had said the words down the horse fell on the ground and there it lay dead and never moved again .,surprise
"i have still two wishes left "" said he and comforted himself with that thought .",joy
and now as he was walking slowly through the sand and the sun was burning hot at noon day he grew quite hot tempered and angry .,anger
then it came into his mind what an easy life his wife had for she stayed at home in a cool room and enjoyed herself .,joy
"this really did vex him and before he was aware he said "" i just wish she was sitting there on this saddle and could not get off it instead of my having to drag it along on my back .",anger
and as the last word was spoken the saddle disappeared from his back and he saw that his second wish had been fulfilled .,surprise
then he really did feel warm .,anger
but when he arrived there and opened the parlour door he saw his wife sitting in the middle of the room on the saddle crying and complaining and quite unable to get off it .,anger
"she however called him a fool and said "" what good will all the riches on earth do me if i am to sit on this saddle ?",anger
thou hast wished me on it so thou must help me off .,anger
so he got nothing by it but vexation trouble abuse and the loss of his horse; but the poor people lived happily quietly and piously until their happy death .,joy
stay here thou wilt be of no use out there besides thou mightest get lost !,surprise
then thumbling began to cry and for the sake of peace his father put him in his pocket and took him with him .,sadness
"now that will do "" said the giant "" thou art perfect "" and took him back to the field from whence he had brought him .",joy
"the farmer was alarmed and said "" no thou art not my son; i don "" t want thee leave me !",anger
truly i am your son; allow me to do your work i can plough as well as you nay better .,surprise
no no thou art not my son; and thou canst not plough go away !,anger
"the farmer could not bear to see that and called to him "" if thou art determined to plough thou must not press so hard on it that makes bad work .",anger
"when he entered the yard his mother did not recognize him and asked "" who is that horrible tall man ?",anger
"she said "" no that cannot be our son we never had such a tall one ours was a little thing .",anger
"she called to him "" go away we do not want thee !",anger
the farmer was glad put his two horses in his cart and fetched from the smith a staff so large and thick that the two horses could only just bring it away .,joy
"the son snapped this also in twain against his knees threw it away and said "" father this can be of no use to me you must harness more horses and bring a stronger staff .",anger
"when the son took it in his hand he broke off a bit from the top of it also and said "" father i see that you will not be able to procure me any such staff as i want i will remain no longer with you .",anger
the miser was heartily satisfied and thought he would thus save much money .,joy
"then the miser grew angry and said "" oh but i can "" t make any use of you you strike far too powerfully; what will you have for the one blow ?",anger
then the bailiff was satisfied for he too was a covetous fellow .,joy
"ah "" said he quite roughly and surlily "" you may just go then; i shall be back again before any of you .",anger
"then said the bailiff to his wife "" the servant is a good one if he does sleep long he is still home before the others .",joy
the advice pleased the bailiff and the head servant was quite willing to go down the well .,joy
"when he was standing down below at the bottom they rolled down the largest mill stone and thought they had broken his skull but he cried "" chase away those hens from the well they are scratching in the sand up there and throwing the grains into my eyes so that i can "" t see .",anger
as he was hungry and saw the food he too place himself at the table ate with those who were eating and enjoyed it .,joy
"then he said "" if anything of that kind comes again i shall strike out in return .",anger
the miller rejoiced and said that the mill was now released from the spell and wanted to give him much money as a reward .,joy
"and while she was speaking the child plucked off quite a large apple and ran to her sisters saying "" just taste my dear little sisters for never in my life have i tasted anything so delightful .",joy
then the two other sisters also ate some of the apple whereupon all three sank deep down into the earth where they could hear no cock crow .,surprise
when mid day came the king wished to call them to come to dinner but they were nowhere to be found .,surprise
then he was much troubled and made known to the whole land that whosoever brought his daughters back again should have one of them to wife .,sadness
the huntsman was about to do so and stooped on which the mannikin took a stick seized him by the hair and gave him a good beating .,surprise
"oh very badly "" said he and then they lamented their misfortune together but they said nothing about it to the youngest for they did not like him at all and always called him stupid hans because he did not exactly belong to the forest .",sadness
"then said hans to the little mannikin "" what ! canst thou not pick up that piece thyself ?",anger
if thou wilt not take as much trouble as that for thy daily bread thou dost not deserve to have it .,anger
then the mannikin grew very angry and said he was to do it but the huntsman would not and took my dear mannikin and gave him a thorough beating .,anger
then the two were so angry at this that they grew green and yellow .,anger
the princess sprang up threw her arms round his neck embraced and kissed him repeatedly and took her stomacher which was made of pure gold and hung it round his neck .,joy
and they all rejoiced and embraced him and kissed him without stopping .,joy
"in the meantime the youngest huntsman was wandering about the three chambers in great trouble fully expecting to have to end his days there when he saw hanging on the wall a flute; then said he "" why dost thou hang there no one can be merry here ?",surprise
"he looked at the dragons heads likewise and said "" you too cannot help me now .",sadness
when the princesses saw him they fainted .,surprise
hereupon the king was angry and ordered him to be put in prison at once because he thought he must have done some injury to the children .,anger
"then he caused the two brothers to be hanged on the gallows and to the third he gave his youngest daughter and on that occasion i wore a pair of glass shoes and i struck them against a stone and they said "" klink "" and were broken .",anger
"then she said "" yes "" and the two ministers married the two sisters for they were all three fair and beautiful of face especially the queen who had hair like flax .",joy
then the two sisters said to each other that they would throw the beautiful boy into the water .,anger
when a year had gone by the king again went away and the queen had another little boy whom the false sisters likewise took and threw into the water .,surprise
"to thy death art thou sped until god "" s word be said .",anger
"to thy death art thou sped until god "" s word be said .",anger
then the king grew angry and ordered his wife to be cast into prison and therein was she shut up for many long years .,anger
hereupon he was much troubled and asked the old fisherman if that was true ?,sadness
"many thanks "" said she .",joy
and now there was no one at home but the daughter and she mourned for her brothers so much that at last she also begged the fisherman to let her set forth for she wished to go in search of her brothers .,sadness
"many thanks "" replied the old woman .",joy
"when the old woman heard that she became quite friendly and carried her over the water gave her a wand and said to her "" go my daughter ever onwards by this road and when you come to a great black dog you must pass it silently and boldly without either laughing or looking at it .",joy
the maiden found everything exactly as the old woman had said and on her way back she found her two brothers who had sought each other over half the world .,surprise
they went together to the place where the black dog was lying on the road; she struck it in the face and it turned into a handsome prince who went with them to the river .,surprise
she rejoiced much to see them again and carried them all over the water and then she too went away for now she was freed .,joy
the others however went to the old fisherman and all were glad that they had found each other again but they hung the bird on the wall .,joy
she had however grown quite ill and weak .,sadness
then the daughter gave her some of the water of the fountain to drink and she became strong and healthy .,surprise
but the two false sisters were burnt and the daughter married the prince .,joy
"the wife of a rich man fell sick; and when she felt that her end drew nigh she called her only daughter to her bed side and said "" always be a good girl and i will look down from heaven and watch over you .",sadness
soon afterwards she shut her eyes and died and was buried in the garden; and the little girl went every day to her grave and wept and was always good and kind to all about her .,sadness
this new wife had two daughters of her own that she brought home with her; they were fair in face but foul at heart and it was now a sorry time for the poor little girl .,sadness
"what does the good for nothing want in the parlour ? "" said they; "" they who would eat bread should first earn it; away with the kitchen maid !",anger
then they took away her fine clothes and gave her an old grey frock to put on and laughed at her and turned her into the kitchen .,anger
besides that the sisters plagued her in all sorts of ways and laughed at her .,sadness
"then she took it and went to her mother "" s grave and planted it there; and cried so much that it was watered with her tears; and there it grew and became a fine tree .",sadness
three times every day she went to it and cried; and soon a little bird came and built its nest upon the tree and talked with her and watched over her and brought her whatever she wished for .,sadness
then she did as she was told; but when all was done she could not help crying for she thought to herself she should so have liked to have gone with them to the ball; and at last she begged her mother very hard to let her go .,sadness
"you ashputtel ! "" said she; "" you who have nothing to wear no clothes at all and who cannot even dance you want to go to the ball ?",anger
"and when she kept on begging she said at last to get rid of her "" i will throw this dishful of peas into the ash heap and if in two hours "" time you have picked them all out you shall go to the feast too .",anger
then ashputtel brought the dish to her mother overjoyed at the thought that now she should go to the ball .,joy
"but the mother said "" no no ! you slut you have no clothes and cannot dance; you shall not go .",anger
and thus she thought she should at least get rid of her .,joy
and then ashputtel took the dishes to her mother rejoicing to think that she should now go to the ball .,joy
"but her mother said "" it is all of no use you cannot go; you have no clothes and cannot dance and you would only put us to shame "" : and off she went with her two daughters to the ball .",anger
now when all were gone and nobody left at home ashputtel went sorrowfully and sat down under the hazel tree and cried out :,sadness
"thus they danced till a late hour of the night; and then she wanted to go home : and the king "" s son said "" i shall go and take care of you to your home "" ; for he wanted to see where the beautiful maiden lived .",joy
"the father thought to himself "" can it be ashputtel ?",surprise
then both the sisters were overjoyed to hear it; for they had beautiful feet and had no doubt that they could wear the golden slipper .,joy
"then the mother gave her a knife and said "" never mind cut it off; when you are queen you will not care about toes; you will not want to walk .",anger
"so the silly girl cut off her great toe and thus squeezed on the shoe and went to the king "" s son .",anger
then the prince got down and looked at her foot; and he saw by the blood that streamed from it what a trick she had played him .,surprise
"so he turned his horse round and brought the false bride back to her home and said "" this is not the right bride; let the other sister try and put on the slipper .",anger
"but her mother squeezed it in till the blood came and took her to the king "" s son : and he set her as his bride by his side on his horse and rode away with her .",anger
then he looked down and saw that the blood streamed so much from the shoe that her white stockings were quite red .,surprise
"this is not the true bride "" said he to the father; "" have you no other daughters ?",anger
"no "" said he; "" there is only a little dirty ashputtel here the child of my first wife; i am sure she cannot be the bride .",anger
"but the mother said "" no no she is much too dirty; she will not dare to show herself .",anger
"and when he drew near and looked at her face he knew her and said "" this is the right bride .",joy
but the mother and both the sisters were frightened and turned pale with anger as he took ashputtel on his horse and rode away with her .,anger
now this king and queen had plenty of money and plenty of fine clothes to wear and plenty of good things to eat and drink and a coach to ride out in every day : but though they had been married many years they had no children and this grieved them very much indeed .,sadness
"then the queen took pity on the little fish and threw it back again into the river; and before it swam away it lifted its head out of the water and said "" i know what your wish is and it shall be fulfilled in return for your kindness to me you will soon have a daughter .",joy
what the little fish had foretold soon came to pass; and the queen had a little girl so very beautiful that the king could not cease looking on it for joy and said he would hold a great feast and make merry and show the child to all the land .,joy
so twelve fairies came each with a high red cap on her head and red shoes with high heels on her feet and a long white wand in her hand : and after the feast was over they gathered round in a ring and gave all their best gifts to the little princess .,joy
just as eleven of them had done blessing her a great noise was heard in the courtyard and word was brought that the thirteenth fairy was come with a black cap on her head and black shoes on her feet and a broomstick in her hand : and presently up she came into the dininghall .,anger
now as she had not been asked to the feast she was very angry and scolded the king and queen very much and set to work to take her revenge .,anger
"so she cried out "" the king "" s daughter shall in her fifteenth year be wounded by a spindle and fall down dead .",anger
"then the twelfth of the friendly fairies who had not yet given her gift came forward and said that the evil wish must be fulfilled but that she could soften its mischief; so her gift was that the king "" s daughter when the spindle wounded her should not really die but should only fall asleep for a hundred years .",sadness
in the door there was a golden key and when she turned it the door sprang open and there sat an old lady spinning away very busily .,surprise
"why how now good mother "" said the princess; "" what are you doing there ?",surprise
"how prettily that little thing turns round ! "" said the princess and took the spindle and began to try and spin .",joy
"but scarcely had she touched it before the fairy "" s prophecy was fulfilled; the spindle wounded her and she fell down lifeless on the ground .",sadness
however she was not dead but had only fallen into a deep sleep; and the king and the queen who had just come home and all their court fell asleep too; and the horses slept in the stables and the dogs in the court the pigeons on the house top and the very flies slept upon the walls .,surprise
"even the fire on the hearth left off blazing and went to sleep; the jack stopped and the spit that was turning about with a goose upon it for the king "" s dinner stood still; and the cook who was at that moment pulling the kitchen boy by the hair to give him a box on the ear for something he had done amiss let him go and both fell asleep; the butler who was slyly tasting the ale fell asleep with the jug at his lips : and thus everything stood still and slept soundly .",surprise
this however none of them could ever do; for the thorns and bushes laid hold of them as it were with hands; and there they stuck fast and died wretchedly .,sadness
now that very day the hundred years were ended; and as the prince came to the thicket he saw nothing but beautiful flowering shrubs through which he went with ease and they shut in after him as thick as ever .,surprise
she looked so beautiful that he could not take his eyes off her so he stooped down and gave her a kiss .,joy
but the moment he kissed her she opened her eyes and awoke and smiled upon him; and they went out together; and soon the king and queen also awoke and all the court and gazed on each other with great wonder .,joy
"and the horses shook themselves and the dogs jumped up and barked; the pigeons took their heads from under their wings and looked about and flew into the fields; the flies on the walls buzzed again; the fire in the kitchen blazed up; round went the jack and round went the spit with the goose for the king "" s dinner upon it; the butler finished his draught of ale; the maid went on plucking the fowl; and the cook gave the boy the box on his ear .",surprise
and then the prince and briar rose were married and the wedding feast was given; and they lived happily together all their lives long .,joy
"but this beautiful queen fell ill and when she felt that her end drew near she called the king to her and said "" promise me that you will never marry again unless you meet with a wife who is as beautiful as i am and who has golden hair like mine .",sadness
then when the king in his grief promised all she asked she shut her eyes and died .,sadness
but the king was not to be comforted and for a long time never thought of taking another wife .,sadness
"at last however his wise men said "" this will not do; the king must marry again that we may have a queen .",anger
so the messengers came home and had had all their trouble for nothing .,sadness
she is the very image of my dead wife : unless i have her i shall not find any bride upon the whole earth and you say there must be a queen .,anger
"when the courtiers heard this they were shocked and said "" heaven forbid that a father should marry his daughter !",surprise
out of so great a sin no good can come .,surprise
"and his daughter was also shocked but hoped the king would soon give up such thoughts; so she said to him "" before i marry anyone i must have three dresses : one must be of gold like the sun; another must be of shining silver like the moon; and a third must be dazzling as the stars : besides this i want a mantle of a thousand different kinds of fur put together to which every beast in the kingdom must give a part of his skin .",surprise
"look sharp ! "" said the king to the huntsmen "" and see what sort of game lies there .",surprise
"and the huntsmen went up to the tree and when they came back again said "" in the hollow tree there lies a most wonderful beast such as we never saw before; its skin seems to be of a thousand kinds of fur but there it lies fast asleep .",surprise
"see "" said the king "" if you can catch it alive and we will take it with us .",joy
"then they showed her a little corner under the staircase where no light of day ever peeped in and said "" cat skin you may lie and sleep there .",sadness
thus cat skin lived for a long time very sorrowfully .,sadness
"everyone made way for her for nobody knew her and they thought she could be no less than a king "" s daughter .",surprise
"but the king came up to her and held out his hand and danced with her; and he thought in his heart "" i never saw any one half so beautiful .",joy
when the dance was at an end she curtsied; and when the king looked round for her she was gone no one knew wither .,surprise
the guards that stood at the castle gate were called in : but they had seen no one .,surprise
"when she went into the kitchen to her work and began to rake the ashes the cook said "" let that alone till the morning and heat the king "" s soup; i should like to run up now and give a peep : but take care you don "" t let a hair fall into it or you will run a chance of never eating again .",anger
when the dance was over the king ordered his soup to be brought in; and it pleased him so well that he thought he had never tasted any so good before .,joy
at the bottom he saw a gold ring lying; and as he could not make out how it had got there he ordered the cook to be sent for .,surprise
"but the king said "" that is not true; it was better done than you could do it .",anger
"i am a poor child "" said she "" that has lost both father and mother .",sadness
"i am good for nothing "" said she "" but to be scullion girl and to have boots and shoes thrown at my head .",sadness
"but how did you get the ring that was in the soup ? "" asked the king .",surprise
"then she ran to her little cabin washed herself quickly and took her dress out which was silvery as the moon and put it on; and when she went in looking like a king "" s daughter the king went up to her and rejoiced at seeing her again and when the dance began he danced with her .",joy
whilst the cook was above stairs she got the golden necklace and dropped it into the soup; then it was brought to the king who ate it and it pleased him as well as before; so he sent for the cook who was again forced to tell him that cat skin had cooked it .,joy
cat skin was brought again before the king but she still told him that she was only fit to have boots and shoes thrown at her head .,sadness
"you must be a witch catskin "" said the cook; "" for you always put something into your soup so that it pleases the king better than mine .",anger
then she put on her dress which sparkled like the stars and went into the ball room in it; and the king danced with her again and thought she had never looked so beautiful as she did then .,joy
when it was at an end he would have held her fast by the hand but she slipped away and sprang so quickly through the crowd that he lost sight of her : and she ran as fast as she could into her little cabin under the stairs .,surprise
when the king got to the bottom he ordered cat skin to be called once more and soon saw the white finger and the ring that he had put on it whilst they were dancing : so he seized her hand and kept fast hold of it and when she wanted to loose herself and spring away the fur cloak fell off a little on one side and the starry dress sparkled underneath it .,surprise
then he got hold of the fur and tore it off and her golden hair and beautiful form were seen and she could no longer hide herself : so she washed the soot and ashes from her face and showed herself to be the most beautiful princess upon the face of the earth .,surprise
"but the king said "" you are my beloved bride and we will never more be parted from each other .",joy
and the wedding feast was held and a merry day it was as ever was heard of or seen in that country or indeed in any other .,joy
a certain cat had made the acquaintance of a mouse and had said so much to her about the great love and friendship she felt for her that at length the mouse agreed that they should live and keep house together .,joy
"so the pot was placed in safety but it was not long before the cat had a great yearning for it and said to the mouse : "" i want to tell you something little mouse; my cousin has brought a little son into the world and has asked me to be godmother; he is white with brown spots and i am to hold him over the font at the christening .",joy
"yes yes "" answered the mouse "" by all means go and if you get anything very good to eat think of me .",joy
all this however was untrue; the cat had no cousin and had not been asked to be godmother .,surprise
then she took a walk upon the roofs of the town looked out for opportunities and then stretched herself in the sun and licked her lips whenever she thought of the pot of fat and not until it was evening did she return home .,joy
"all went off well "" answered the cat .",joy
"top off ! "" said the cat quite coolly .",anger
"top off ! "" cried the mouse "" that is a very odd and uncommon name is it a usual one in your family ?",surprise
"what does that matter "" said the cat "" it is no worse than crumb stealer as your godchildren are called .",anger
before long the cat was seized by another fit of yearning .,joy
"nothing ever seems so good as what one keeps to oneself "" said she and was quite satisfied with her day "" s work .",joy
what are you saying ?,surprise
"i never heard the name in my life i "" ll wager anything it is not in the calendar !",surprise
"the cat "" s mouth soon began to water for some more licking .",joy
"you sit at home "" said the cat "" in your dark grey fur coat and long tail and are filled with fancies that "" s because you do not go out in the daytime .",anger
"during the cat "" s absence the mouse cleaned the house and put it in order but the greedy cat entirely emptied the pot of fat .",sadness
"when everything is eaten up one has some peace "" said she to herself and well filled and fat she did not return home till night .",joy
"all gone "" cried the mouse "" that is the most suspicious name of all !",surprise
i have never seen it in print .,surprise
"all gone; what can that mean ? "" and she shook her head curled herself up and lay down to sleep .",surprise
"from this time forth no one invited the cat to be godmother but when the winter had come and there was no longer anything to be found outside the mouse thought of their provision and said : "" come cat we will go to our pot of fat which we have stored up for ourselves we shall enjoy that .",joy
"yes "" answered the cat "" you will enjoy it as much as you would enjoy sticking that dainty tongue of yours out of the window .",anger
"alas ! "" said the mouse "" now i see what has happened now it comes to light !",surprise
you a true friend !,surprise
you have devoured all when you were standing godmother .,sadness
"first top off then half done then "" "" will you hold your tongue "" cried the cat "" one word more and i will eat you too .",anger
"all gone "" was already on the poor mouse "" s lips; scarcely had she spoken it before the cat sprang on her seized her and swallowed her down .",anger
when she was below she fetched herself a chair and set it before the barrel so that she had no need to stoop and did not hurt her back or do herself any unexpected injury .,joy
then she sat and wept and screamed with all the strength of her body over the misfortune which lay before her .,sadness
those upstairs waited for the drink but clever elsie still did not come .,sadness
the maid went and found her sitting in front of the barrel screaming loudly .,sadness
"elsie why do you weep ? "" asked the maid .",sadness
"ah "" she answered "" have i not reason to weep ?",sadness
"then said the maid : "" what a clever elsie we have ! "" and sat down beside her and began loudly to weep over the misfortune .",sadness
the boy went down and there sat clever elsie and the girl both weeping together .,sadness
"then he asked : "" why are you weeping ?",sadness
"ah "" said elsie "" have i not reason to weep ?",sadness
if i get hans and we have a child and he grows big and has to draw beer here the pick axe will fall on his head and kill him .,sadness
"then said the boy : "" what a clever elsie we have ! "" and sat down by her and likewise began to howl loudly .",sadness
the woman went down and found all three in the midst of their lamentations and inquired what was the cause; then elsie told her also that her future child was to be killed by the pick axe when it grew big and had to draw beer and the pick axe fell down .,sadness
"then said the mother likewise : "" what a clever elsie we have ! "" and sat down and wept with them .",sadness
"the man upstairs waited a short time but as his wife did not come back and his thirst grew ever greater he said : "" i must go into the cellar myself and see where elsie is .",anger
"but when he got into the cellar and they were all sitting together crying and he heard the reason and that elsie "" s child was the cause and the elsie might perhaps bring one into the world some day and that he might be killed by the pick axe if he should happen to be sitting beneath it drawing beer just at the very time when it fell down he cried : "" oh what a clever elsie ! "" and sat down and likewise wept with them .",sadness
when he got down the five of them were sitting screaming and lamenting quite piteously each outdoing the other .,sadness
"ah dear hans "" said elsie "" if we marry each other and have a child and he is big and we perhaps send him here to draw something to drink then the pick axe which has been left up there might dash his brains out if it were to fall down so have we not reason to weep ?",sadness
"come "" said hans "" more understanding than that is not needed for my household as you are such a clever elsie i will have you "" and seized her hand took her upstairs with him and married her .",joy
"hans had been at home for a long time but elsie did not come; then said he : "" what a clever elsie i have; she is so industrious that she does not even come home to eat .",joy
but when evening came and she still stayed away hans went out to see what she had cut but nothing was cut and she was lying among the corn asleep .,surprise
"there was once a cook named gretel who wore shoes with red heels and when she walked out with them on she turned herself this way and that was quite happy and thought : "" you certainly are a pretty girl !",joy
"and when she came home she drank in her gladness of heart a draught of wine and as wine excites a desire to eat she tasted the best of whatever she was cooking until she was satisfied and said : "" the cook must know what the food is like .",joy
"then gretel called out to her master : "" if the guest does not come i must take the fowls away from the fire but it will be a sin and a shame if they are not eaten the moment they are at their juiciest .",sadness
"she ran down set a jug said : "" god bless it for you gretel "" and took a good drink and thought that wine should flow on and should not be interrupted and took yet another hearty draught .",joy
then she went and put the fowls down again to the fire basted them and drove the spit merrily round .,joy
"but as the roast meat smelt so good gretel thought : "" something might be wrong it ought to be tasted !",joy
"she touched it with her finger and said : "" ah ! how good fowls are !",joy
it certainly is a sin and a shame that they are not eaten at the right time !,sadness
"she ran to the window to see if the master was not coming with his guest but she saw no one and went back to the fowls and thought : "" one of the wings is burning !",surprise
"so she cut it off ate it and enjoyed it and when she had done she thought : "" the other must go down too or else master will observe that something is missing .",joy
"it suddenly occurred to her : "" who knows ?",surprise
"then she said : "" well gretel enjoy yourself one fowl has been cut into take another drink and eat it up entirely; when it is eaten you will have some peace why should god "" s good gifts be spoilt ?",joy
so she ran into the cellar again took an enormous drink and ate up the one chicken in great glee .,joy
presently the guest came and knocked politely and courteously at the house door .,joy
"gretel was not idle; she ran screaming to her master and cried : "" you have invited a fine guest !",anger
why gretel ?,surprise
what do you mean by that ?,surprise
"yes "" said she "" he has taken the chickens which i was just going to serve up off the dish and has run away with them !",anger
"that "" s a nice trick ! "" said her master and lamented the fine chickens .",sadness
if he had but left me one so that something remained for me to eat .,sadness

where have you left gretel ?,anger
i led her by the rope tied her to the rack and scattered some grass for her .,joy
that was ill done hans you should have cast friendly eyes on her .,anger
never mind will do better .,sadness
then gretel became angry tore herself loose and ran away and was no longer the bride of hans .,anger
when the money was being counted out to him it so happened that the doctor was sitting at table and when the peasant saw how well he ate and drank his heart desired what he saw and would willingly have been a doctor too .,sadness
"oh yes "" said the doctor "" that is soon managed .",surprise
when he had doctored people awhile but not long a rich and great lord had some money stolen .,sadness
so the lord had the horses harnessed to his carriage drove out to the village and asked crabb if he were doctor knowall .,anger
"yes but my wife grete too "" said he and he seated himself with her at the table .",anger
"the doctor looked at the dish had no idea what to say and cried : "" ah poor crabb .",sadness
"when the lord heard that he cried : "" there ! he knows it; he must also know who has the money !",surprise
"with this the doctor was satisfied and returned to the hall sat down to the table and said : "" my lord now will i search in my book where the gold is hidden .",joy
"as he could not find it immediately he said : "" i know you are there so you had better come out !",anger
then doctor knowall showed the lord where the money was but did not say who had stolen it and received from both sides much money in reward and became a renowned man .,joy
mrs fox went up to her room shut herself in and her maid miss cat sat by the fire and did the cooking .,sadness
she is sitting in her room moaning in her gloom weeping her little eyes quite red because old mr fox is dead .,sadness
do just tell her miss that a young fox is here who would like to woo her .,joy
"oh yes my little cat "" she cried .",sadness
what does he look like my dear ?,surprise
has he nine as beautiful tails as the late mr fox ?,sadness
"oh no "" answered the cat "" he has only one .",sadness
then i will not have him .,sadness
after this still more came each with one tail more than the other but they were all turned away until at last one came who had nine tails like old mr fox .,joy
when the widow heard that she said joyfully to the cat :,joy
now open the gates and doors all wide and carry old mr fox outside .,joy
but just as the wedding was going to be solemnized old mr fox stirred under the bench and cudgelled all the rabble and drove them and mrs fox out of the house .,anger
kate !,joy
"at last it popped into her head "" the dog is not shut up he may be running away with the steak; that "" s well thought of .",surprise
so up she ran from the cellar; and sure enough the rascally cur had got the steak in his mouth and was making off with it .,surprise
"it "" s all gone and "" what can "" t be cured must be endured "" "" said catherine .",sadness
now all this time the ale was running too for catherine had not turned the cock; and when the jug was full the liquor ran upon the floor till the cask was empty .,surprise
when she got to the cellar stairs she saw what had happened .,surprise
"my stars ! "" said she "" what shall i do to keep frederick from seeing all this slopping about ?",surprise
"what a lucky thing "" said she "" that we kept that meal ! we have now a good use for it .",joy
so away she went for it : but she managed to set it down just upon the great jug full of beer and upset it; and thus all the ale that had been saved was set swimming on the floor also .,surprise
"ah ! well "" said she "" when one goes another may as well follow .",anger
"then she strewed the meal all about the cellar and was quite pleased with her cleverness and said "" how very neat and clean it looks !",joy
"o frederick ! "" answered she "" i was cooking you a steak; but while i went down to draw the ale the dog ran away with it; and while i ran after him the ale ran out; and when i went to dry up the ale with the sack of meal that we got at the fair i upset the jug : but the cellar is now quite dry and looks so clean !",anger
"kate kate "" said he "" how could you do all this ?",anger
why did you leave the steak to fry and the ale to run and then spoil all the meal ?,anger
"why frederick "" said she "" i did not know i was doing wrong; you should have told me before .",sadness
"the husband thought to himself "" if my wife manages matters thus i must look sharp myself .",surprise
"now he had a good deal of gold in the house : so he said to catherine "" what pretty yellow buttons these are !",joy
oh dear me i should like to buy very much but i have no money : if you had any use for yellow buttons i might deal with you .,sadness
"yellow buttons ! "" said they : "" let us have a look at them .",surprise
so the rogues went : and when they found what these yellow buttons were they took them all away and left her plenty of plates and dishes .,joy
"then she set them all about the house for a show : and when frederick came back he cried out "" kate what have you been doing ?",surprise
"see "" said she "" i have bought all these with your yellow buttons : but i did not touch them myself; the pedlars went themselves and dug them up .",joy
"wife wife "" said frederick "" what a pretty piece of work you have made ! those yellow buttons were all my money : how came you to do such a thing ?",anger
"why "" answered she "" i did not know there was any harm in it; you should have told me .",sadness
"catherine stood musing for a while and at last said to her husband "" hark ye frederick we will soon get the gold back : let us run after the thieves .",joy
"well we will try "" answered he; "" but take some butter and cheese with you that we may have something to eat by the way .",joy
"very well "" said she; and they set out : and as frederick walked the fastest he left his wife some way behind .",anger
"it does not matter "" thought she : "" when we turn back i shall be so much nearer home than he .",joy
"ah see now "" said she "" how they have bruised and wounded those poor trees; they will never get well .",sadness
so she took pity on them and made use of the butter to grease them all so that the wheels might not hurt them so much .,sadness
"catherine looked but could not see where it had gone; so she said "" well i suppose the other will go the same way and find you; he has younger legs than i have .",surprise
but she said she supposed that they knew the road and would follow her and she could not stay there all day waiting for them .,anger
"where are the butter and cheese ? "" said he .",surprise
"oh ! "" answered she "" i used the butter to grease those poor trees that the wheels chafed so : and one of the cheeses ran away so i sent the other after it to find it and i suppose they are both on the road together somewhere .",joy
"what a goose you are to do such silly things ! "" said the husband .",anger
"how can you say so ? "" said she; "" i am sure you never told me not .",sadness
"they ate the dry bread together; and frederick said "" kate i hope you locked the door safe when you came away .",anger
"no "" answered she "" you did not tell me .",surprise
"then go home and do it now before we go any farther "" said frederick "" and bring with you something to eat .",anger
"catherine did as he told her and thought to herself by the way "" frederick wants something to eat; but i don "" t think he is very fond of butter and cheese : i "" ll bring him a bag of fine nuts and the vinegar for i have often seen him take some .",joy
"when she reached home she bolted the back door but the front door she took off the hinges and said "" frederick told me to lock the door but surely it can nowhere be so safe if i take it with me .",surprise
"so she took her time by the way; and when she overtook her husband she cried out "" there frederick there is the door itself you may watch it as carefully as you please .",joy
"alas ! alas ! "" said he "" what a clever wife i have !",surprise
i sent you to make the house fast and you take the door away so that everybody may go in and out as they please however as you have brought the door you shall carry it about with you for your pains .,anger
scarcely were they up than who should come by but the very rogues they were looking for .,surprise
"then he climbed up again and tried to hit the thieves on the head with them : but they only said "" it must be near morning for the wind shakes the fir apples down .",surprise
"catherine who had the door on her shoulder began to be very tired; but she thought it was the nuts upon it that were so heavy : so she said softly "" frederick i must let the nuts go .",sadness
"no "" answered he "" not now they will discover us .",anger
"i can "" t help that : they must go .",anger
well then make haste and throw them down if you will .,anger
"then away rattled the nuts down among the boughs and one of the thieves cried "" bless me it is hailing .",anger
"a little while after catherine thought the door was still very heavy : so she whispered to frederick "" i must throw the vinegar down .",sadness
"pray don "" t "" answered he "" it will discover us .",anger
"i can "" t help that "" said she "" go it must .",anger
"so she poured all the vinegar down; and the thieves said "" what a heavy dew there is !",surprise
"at last it popped into catherine "" s head that it was the door itself that was so heavy all the time : so she whispered "" frederick i must throw the door down soon .",sadness
but he begged and prayed her not to do so for he was sure it would betray them .,anger
so when frederick and catherine came down there they found all their money safe and sound .,joy
there was once a forester who went into the forest to hunt and as he entered it he heard a sound of screaming as if a little child were there .,surprise
he followed the sound and at last came to a high tree and at the top of this a little child was sitting for the mother had fallen asleep under the tree with the child and a bird of prey had seen it in her arms had flown down snatched it away and set it on the high tree .,surprise
"the forester climbed up brought the child down and thought to himself : "" you will take him home with you and bring him up with your lina .",joy
fundevogel and lina loved each other so dearly that when they did not see each other they were sad .,sadness
"lina saw this and said "" listen old sanna why are you fetching so much water ?",surprise
"so lina said no she would never repeat it to anyone and then the cook said : "" early tomorrow morning when the forester is out hunting i will heat the water and when it is boiling in the kettle i will throw in fundevogel and will boil him in it .",anger
"fundevogel said : "" neither now nor ever will i leave you .",joy
but when she came in and went to the beds both the children were gone .,surprise
"fundevogel said : "" neither now nor ever .",joy
when the three servants came to the forest nothing was there but a rose tree and one rose on it but the children were nowhere .,surprise
"then said they : "" there is nothing to be done here "" and they went home and told the cook that they had seen nothing in the forest but a little rose bush with one rose on it .",anger
"then the old cook scolded and said : "" you simpletons you should have cut the rose bush in two and have broken off the rose and brought it home with you; go and do it at once .",anger
"then lina said : "" fundevogel never leave me and i will never leave you .",joy
"fundevogel said : "" neither now; nor ever .",joy
so when the three servants came nothing was there but a church with a chandelier in it .,surprise
"they said therefore to each other : "" what can we do here let us go home .",anger
"and the cook scolded them and said : "" you fools ! why did you not pull the church to pieces and bring the chandelier home with you ?",anger
and now the old cook herself got on her legs and went with the three servants in pursuit of the children .,anger
"then said lina : "" fundevogel never leave me and i will never leave you .",joy
"then said fundevogel : "" neither now nor ever .",joy
but the duck swam quickly to her seized her head in its beak and drew her into the water and there the old witch had to drown .,surprise
then the children went home together and were heartily delighted and if they have not died they are living still .,joy
he had little to bite and to break and once when great dearth fell on the land he could no longer procure even daily bread .,sadness
"now when he thought over this by night in his bed and tossed about in his anxiety he groaned and said to his wife : "" what is to become of us ?",sadness
how are we to feed our poor children when we no longer have anything even for ourselves ?,sadness
"i "" ll tell you what husband "" answered the woman "" early tomorrow morning we will take the children out into the forest to where it is the thickest; there we will light a fire for them and give each of them one more piece of bread and then we will go to our work and leave them alone .",surprise
they will not find the way home again and we shall be rid of them .,surprise
"no wife "" said the man "" i will not do that; how can i bear to leave my children alone in the forest ? the wild animals would soon come and tear them to pieces .",sadness
"o you fool ! "" said she "" then we must all four die of hunger you may as well plane the planks for our coffins "" and she left him no peace until he consented .",anger
"but i feel very sorry for the poor children all the same "" said the man .",sadness
"gretel wept bitter tears and said to hansel : "" now all is over with us .",sadness
"be quiet gretel "" said hansel "" do not distress yourself i will soon find a way to help us .",joy
"then he went back and said to gretel : "" be comforted dear little sister and sleep in peace god will not forsake us "" and he lay down again in his bed .",joy
"when day dawned but before the sun had risen the woman came and awoke the two children saying : "" get up you sluggards ! we are going into the forest to fetch wood .",anger
"she gave each a little piece of bread and said : "" there is something for your dinner but do not eat it up before then for you will get nothing else .",anger
"his father said : "" hansel what are you looking at there and staying behind for ?",anger
pay attention and do not forget how to use your legs .,anger
"the wife said : "" fool that is not your little cat that is the morning sun which is shining on the chimneys .",anger
hansel and gretel sat by the fire and when noon came each ate a little piece of bread and as they heard the strokes of the wood axe they believed that their father was near .,surprise
it was not the axe however but a branch which he had fastened to a withered tree which the wind was blowing backwards and forwards .,surprise
"gretel began to cry and said : "" how are we to get out of the forest now ?",sadness
and when the full moon had risen hansel took his little sister by the hand and followed the pebbles which shone like newly coined silver pieces and showed them the way .,joy
"they walked the whole night long and by break of day came once more to their father "" s house .",joy
"they knocked at the door and when the woman opened it and saw that it was hansel and gretel she said : "" you naughty children why have you slept so long in the forest ? we thought you were never coming back at all !",anger
the father however rejoiced for it had cut him to the heart to leave them behind alone .,joy
"not long afterwards there was once more great dearth throughout the land and the children heard their mother saying at night to their father : "" everything is eaten again we have one half loaf left and that is the end .",surprise
"the man "" s heart was heavy and he thought : "" it would be better for you to share the last mouthful with your children .",sadness
the woman however would listen to nothing that he had to say but scolded and reproached him .,anger
when the old folks were asleep hansel again got up and wanted to go out and pick up pebbles as he had done before but the woman had locked the door and hansel could not get out .,sadness
"nevertheless he comforted his little sister and said : "" do not cry gretel go to sleep quietly the good god will help us .",sadness
"hansel why do you stop and look round ? "" said the father "" go on .",anger
"fool ! "" said the woman "" that is not your little pigeon that is the morning sun that is shining on the chimney .",anger
then they fell asleep and evening passed but no one came to the poor children .,sadness
"they did not awake until it was dark night and hansel comforted his little sister and said : "" just wait gretel until the moon rises and then we shall see the crumbs of bread which i have strewn about they will show us our way home again .",sadness
when the moon came they set out but they found no crumbs for the many thousands of birds which fly about in the woods and fields had picked them all up .,surprise
"hansel said to gretel : "" we shall soon find the way "" but they did not find it .",sadness
they walked the whole night and all the next day too from morning till evening but they did not get out of the forest and were very hungry for they had nothing to eat but two or three berries which grew on the ground .,sadness
and as they were so weary that their legs would carry them no longer they lay down beneath a tree and fell asleep .,sadness
they began to walk again but they always came deeper into the forest and if help did not come soon they must die of hunger and weariness .,sadness
when it was mid day they saw a beautiful snow white bird sitting on a bough which sang so delightfully that they stood still and listened to it .,joy
and when its song was over it spread its wings and flew away before them and they followed it until they reached a little house on the roof of which it alighted; and when they approached the little house they saw that it was built of bread and covered with cakes but that the windows were of clear sugar .,surprise
"we will set to work on that "" said hansel "" and have a good meal .",joy
i will eat a bit of the roof and you gretel can eat some of the window it will taste sweet .,joy
nibble nibble gnaw who is nibbling at my little house ?,anger
hansel who liked the taste of the roof tore down a great piece of it and gretel pushed out the whole of one round window pane sat down and enjoyed herself with it .,joy
suddenly the door opened and a woman as old as the hills who supported herself on crutches came creeping out .,surprise
"the old woman however nodded her head and said : "" oh you dear children who has brought you here ? do come in and stay with me .",surprise
then good food was set before them milk and pancakes with sugar apples and nuts .,surprise
afterwards two pretty little beds were covered with clean white linen and hansel and gretel lay down in them and thought they were in heaven .,joy
the old woman had only pretended to be so kind; she was in reality a wicked witch who lay in wait for children and had only built the little house of bread in order to entice them there .,surprise
when a child fell into her power she killed it cooked and ate it and that was a feast day with her .,surprise
witches have red eyes and cannot see far but they have a keen scent like the beasts and are aware when human beings draw near .,surprise
"when hansel and gretel came into her neighbourhood she laughed with malice and said mockingly : "" i have them they shall not escape me again !",joy
"early in the morning before the children were awake she was already up and when she saw both of them sleeping and looking so pretty with their plump and rosy cheeks she muttered to herself : "" that will be a dainty mouthful !",joy
then she seized hansel with her shrivelled hand carried him into a little stable and locked him in behind a grated door .,surprise
"then she went to gretel shook her till she awoke and cried : "" get up lazy thing fetch some water and cook something good for your brother he is in the stable outside and is to be made fat .",anger
when he is fat i will eat him .,surprise
gretel began to weep bitterly but it was all in vain for she was forced to do what the wicked witch commanded .,sadness
and now the best food was cooked for poor hansel but gretel got nothing but crab shells .,sadness
"every morning the woman crept to the little stable and cried : "" hansel stretch out your finger that i may feel if you will soon be fat .",anger
"hansel however stretched out a little bone to her and the old woman who had dim eyes could not see it and thought it was hansel "" s finger and was astonished that there was no way of fattening him .",surprise
when four weeks had gone by and hansel still remained thin she was seized with impatience and would not wait any longer .,anger
let hansel be fat or lean tomorrow i will kill him and cook him .,joy
ah how the poor little sister did lament when she had to fetch the water and how her tears did flow down her cheeks !,sadness
"dear god do help us "" she cried .",sadness
if the wild beasts in the forest had but devoured us we should at any rate have died together .,sadness
"just keep your noise to yourself "" said the old woman "" it won "" t help you at all .",anger
and once gretel was inside she intended to shut the oven and let her bake in it and then she would eat her too .,joy
"silly goose "" said the old woman .",anger
"the door is big enough; just look i can get in myself ! "" and she crept up and thrust her head into the oven .",anger
then gretel gave her a push that drove her far into it and shut the iron door and fastened the bolt .,surprise
oh ! then she began to howl quite horribly but gretel ran away and the godless witch was miserably burnt to death .,anger
"gretel however ran like lightning to hansel opened his little stable and cried : "" hansel we are saved !",joy
the old witch is dead !,joy
then hansel sprang like a bird from its cage when the door is opened .,joy
how they did rejoice and embrace each other and dance about and kiss each other !,joy
"and as they had no longer any need to fear her they went into the witch "" s house and in every corner there stood chests full of pearls and jewels .",surprise
"these are far better than pebbles ! "" said hansel and thrust into his pockets whatever could be got in and gretel said : "" i too will take something home with me "" and filled her pinafore full .",surprise
"we cannot cross "" said hansel "" i see no foot plank and no bridge .",sadness
"and there is also no ferry "" answered gretel "" but a white duck is swimming there : if i ask her she will help us over .",joy
the duck came to them and hansel seated himself on its back and told his sister to sit by him .,joy
"the good little duck did so and when they were once safely across and had walked for a short time the forest seemed to be more and more familiar to them and at length they saw from afar their father "" s house .",joy
"then they began to run rushed into the parlour and threw themselves round their father "" s neck .",joy
the man had not known one happy hour since he had left the children in the forest; the woman however was dead .,joy
gretel emptied her pinafore until pearls and precious stones ran about the room and hansel threw one handful after another out of his pocket to add to them .,surprise
then all anxiety was at an end and they lived together in perfect happiness .,joy
my tale is done there runs a mouse; whosoever catches it may make himself a big fur cap out of it .,joy
"at last he said "" master my time is up; i must go home and see my poor mother once more : so pray pay me my wages and let me go .",sadness
"and the master said "" you have been a faithful and good servant hans so your pay shall be handsome .",joy
hans took out his pocket handkerchief put the piece of silver into it threw it over his shoulder and jogged off on his road homewards .,joy
"ah ! "" said hans aloud "" what a fine thing it is to ride on horseback !",surprise
there he sits as easy and happy as if he was at home in the chair by his fireside; he trips against no stones saves shoe leather and gets on he hardly knows how .,joy
"hans did not speak so softly but the horseman heard it all and said "" well friend why do you go on foot then ?",surprise
"ah ! "" said he "" i have this load to carry : to be sure it is silver but it is so heavy that i can "" t hold up my head and you must know it hurts my shoulder sadly .",anger
"with all my heart "" said hans : "" but as you are so kind to me i must tell you one thing you will have a weary task to draw that silver about with you .",surprise
hans was delighted as he sat on the horse drew himself up squared his elbows turned out his toes cracked his whip and rode merrily off one minute whistling a merry tune and another singing,joy
no care and no sorrow a fig for the morrow !,joy
"we "" ll laugh and be merry sing neigh down derry !",joy
away went the horse full gallop; and before hans knew what he was about he was thrown off and lay on his back by the road side .,surprise
his horse would have ran off if a shepherd who was coming by driving a cow had not stopped it .,joy
"hans soon came to himself and got upon his legs again sadly vexed and said to the shepherd "" this riding is no joke when a man has the luck to get upon a beast like this that stumbles and flings him off as if it would break his neck .",sadness
"however i "" m off now once for all : i like your cow now a great deal better than this smart beast that played me this trick and has spoiled my best coat you see in this puddle; which by the by smells not very like a nosegay .",anger
what would i give to have such a prize !,joy
"well "" said the shepherd "" if you are so fond of her i will change my cow for your horse; i like to do good to my neighbours even though i lose by it myself .",joy
"done ! "" said hans merrily .",surprise
"what a noble heart that good man has ! "" thought he .",joy
then the shepherd jumped upon the horse wished hans and the cow good morning and away he rode .,joy
hans brushed his coat wiped his face and hands rested a while and then drove off his cow quietly and thought his bargain a very lucky one .,joy
if i have only a piece of bread ( and i certainly shall always be able to get that ) i can whenever i like eat my butter and cheese with it; and when i am thirsty i can milk my cow and drink the milk : and what can i wish for more ?,joy
but the heat grew greater as soon as noon came on till at last as he found himself on a wide heath that would take him more than an hour to cross he began to be so hot and parched that his tongue clave to the roof of his mouth .,anger
"i can find a cure for this "" thought he; "" now i will milk my cow and quench my thirst "" : so he tied her to the stump of a tree and held his leathern cap to milk into; but not a drop was to be had .",sadness
who would have thought that this cow which was to bring him milk and butter and cheese was all that time utterly dry ?,sadness
hans had not thought of looking to that .,surprise
while he was trying his luck in milking and managing the matter very clumsily the uneasy beast began to think him very troublesome; and at last gave him such a kick on the head as knocked him down; and there he lay a long while senseless .,surprise
luckily a butcher soon came by driving a pig in a wheelbarrow .,joy
"what is the matter with you my man ? "" said the butcher as he helped him up .",surprise
hans told him what had happened how he was dry and wanted to milk his cow but found the cow was dry too .,sadness
"then the butcher gave him a flask of ale saying "" there drink and refresh yourself; your cow will give you no milk : don "" t you see she is an old beast good for nothing but the slaughter house ?",surprise
"alas alas ! "" said hans "" who would have thought it ?",anger
what a shame to take my horse and give me only a dry cow !,anger
if i kill her what will she be good for ?,sadness
i hate cow beef; it is not tender enough for me .,anger
if it were a pig now like that fat gentleman you are driving along at his ease one could do something with it; it would at any rate make sausages .,sadness
"well "" said the butcher "" i don "" t like to say no when one is asked to do a kind neighbourly thing .",joy
to please you i will change and give you my fine fat pig for the cow .,joy
"heaven reward you for your kindness and self denial ! "" said hans as he gave the butcher the cow; and taking the pig off the wheel barrow drove it away holding it by the string that was tied to its leg .",joy
so on he jogged and all seemed now to go right with him : he had met with some misfortunes to be sure; but he was now well repaid for all .,joy
how could it be otherwise with such a travelling companion as he had at last got ?,joy
"the countryman stopped to ask what was o "" clock; this led to further chat; and hans told him all his luck how he had so many good bargains and how all the world went gay and smiling with him .",joy
"feel "" said he "" how heavy it is and yet it is only eight weeks old .",joy
whoever roasts and eats it will find plenty of fat upon it it has lived so well !,joy
meantime the countryman began to look grave and shook his head .,sadness
"hark ye ! "" said he "" my worthy friend you seem a good sort of fellow so i can "" t help doing you a kind turn .",joy
the least they will do will be to throw you into the horse pond .,sadness
"i ought to have something into the bargain "" said the countryman; "" give a fat goose for a pig indeed !",joy
tis not everyone would do so much for you as that .,anger
however i will not be hard upon you as you are in trouble .,joy
then he took the string in his hand and drove off the pig by a side path; while hans went on the way homewards free from care .,joy
"after all "" thought he "" that chap is pretty well taken in .",joy
"i don "" t care whose pig it is but wherever it came from it has been a very good friend to me .",joy
i have much the best of the bargain .,joy
first there will be a capital roast; then the fat will find me in goose grease for six months; and then there are all the beautiful white feathers .,joy
i will put them into my pillow and then i am sure i shall sleep soundly without rocking .,joy
how happy my mother will be !,joy
talk of a pig indeed !,joy
give me a fine fat goose .,joy
"o "" er hill and o "" er dale so happy i roam work light and live well all the world is my home; then who so blythe so merry as i ?",joy
"hans stood looking on for a while and at last said "" you must be well off master grinder ! you seem so happy at your work .",joy
"yes "" said the other "" mine is a golden trade; a good grinder never puts his hand into his pocket without finding money in it but where did you get that beautiful goose ?",joy
and where did you get the pig ?,surprise
i gave a lump of silver as big as my head for it .,sadness
oh !,surprise
very true : but how is that to be managed ?,surprise
"how can you ask ? "" said hans; "" i should be the happiest man in the world if i could have money whenever i put my hand in my pocket : what could i want more ? there "" s the goose .",joy
"hans took the stone and went his way with a light heart : his eyes sparkled for joy and he said to himself "" surely i must have been born in a lucky hour; everything i could want or wish for comes of itself .",joy
people are so kind; they seem really to think i do them a favour in letting them make me rich and giving me good bargains .,joy
at last he could go no farther for the stone tired him sadly : and he dragged himself to the side of a river that he might take a drink of water and rest a while .,sadness
so he laid the stone carefully by his side on the bank : but as he stooped down to drink he forgot it pushed it a little and down it rolled plump into the stream .,surprise
for a while he watched it sinking in the deep clear water; then sprang up and danced for joy and again fell upon his knees and thanked heaven with tears in his eyes for its kindness in taking away his only plague the ugly heavy stone .,joy
"how happy am i ! "" cried he; "" nobody was ever so lucky as i .",joy
"then up he got with a light heart free from all his troubles and walked on till he reached his mother "" s house and told her how very easy the road to good luck was .",joy
"the huntsman replied : "" lord i will venture it at my own risk of fear i know nothing .",anger
when they could see to the bottom there lay a wild man whose body was brown like rusty iron and whose hair hung over his face down to his knees .,anger
there was great astonishment over the wild man; the king however had him put in an iron cage in his courtyard and forbade the door to be opened on pain of death and the queen herself was to take the key into her keeping .,surprise
and from this time forth everyone could again go into the forest with safety .,joy
the king had a son of eight years who was once playing in the courtyard and while he was playing his golden ball fell into the cage .,sadness
"the boy ran thither and said : "" give me my ball out .",anger
"not till you have opened the door for me "" answered the man .",anger
"no "" said the boy "" i will not do that; the king has forbidden it "" and ran away .",anger
"on the third day the king had ridden out hunting and the boy went once more and said : "" i cannot open the door even if i wished for i have not the key .",sadness
the boy who wanted to have his ball back cast all thought to the winds and brought the key .,sadness
the door opened with difficulty and the boy pinched his fingers .,sadness
when it was open the wild man stepped out gave him the golden ball and hurried away .,joy
when the king came home he observed the empty cage and asked the queen how that had happened .,anger
she knew nothing about it and sought the key but it was gone .,surprise
then he could easily guess what had happened and much grief reigned in the royal court .,sadness
"when the wild man had once more reached the dark forest he took the boy down from his shoulder and said to him : "" you will never see your father and mother again but i will keep you with me for you have set me free and i have compassion on you .",sadness
if you do all i bid you you shall fare well .,joy
of treasure and gold have i enough and more than anyone in the world .,joy
as he was thus sitting his finger hurt him so violently that he involuntarily put it in the water .,sadness
"in the evening iron hans came back looked at the boy and said : "" what has happened to the well ?",anger
"but he said : "" you have dipped your finger into the water this time it may pass but take care you do not again let anything go in .",anger
iron hans came and already knew what had happened .,anger
"you have let a hair fall into the well "" said he .",anger
i will allow you to watch by it once more but if this happens for the third time then the well is polluted and you can no longer remain with me .,anger
but the time was long to him and he looked at the reflection of his face on the surface of the water .,sadness
and as he still bent down more and more while he was doing so and trying to look straight into the eyes his long hair fell down from his shoulders into the water .,surprise
he raised himself up quickly but the whole of the hair of his head was already golden and shone like the sun .,surprise
"when he came he already knew everything and said : "" take the handkerchief off .",anger
then the golden hair streamed forth and let the boy excuse himself as he might it was of no use .,sadness
you have not stood the trial and can stay here no longer .,anger
go forth into the world there you will learn what poverty is .,anger
"but as you have not a bad heart and as i mean well by you there is one thing i will grant you; if you fall into any difficulty come to the forest and cry : "" iron hans "" and then i will come and help you .",sadness
there he looked for work but could find none and he learnt nothing by which he could help himself .,sadness
the people about court did not at all know what use they could make of him but they liked him and told him to stay .,surprise
"such a thing as that had never yet come under the king "" s notice and he said : "" when you come to the royal table you must take your hat off .",anger
then the king had the cook called before him and scolded him and asked how he could take such a boy as that into his service; and that he was to send him away at once .,anger
"the cook however had pity on him and exchanged him for the gardener "" s boy .",sadness
and now the boy had to plant and water the garden hoe and dig and bear the wind and bad weather .,sadness
"as the sun shone on his hair it glittered and flashed so that the rays fell into the bedroom of the king "" s daughter and up she sprang to see what that could be .",surprise
"then she saw the boy and cried to him : "" boy bring me a wreath of flowers .",surprise
"when he was ascending the stairs with them the gardener met him and said : "" how can you take the king "" s daughter a garland of such common flowers ?",anger
go quickly and get another and seek out the prettiest and rarest .,anger
"oh no "" replied the boy "" the wild ones have more scent and will please her better .",anger
she however caught at his cap and pulled it off and then his golden hair rolled down on his shoulders and it was splendid to behold .,surprise
he wanted to run out but she held him by the arm and gave him a handful of ducats .,surprise
"he took them to the gardener and said : "" i present them to your children they can play with them .",joy
"the following day the king "" s daughter again called to him that he was to bring her a wreath of field flowers and then he went in with it she instantly snatched at his cap and wanted to take it away from him but he held it fast with both hands .",surprise
on the third day things went just the same; she could not get his cap away from him and he would not have her money .,anger
"then said the gardener "" s boy : "" i am grown up and will go to the wars also only give me a horse .",anger
"the others laughed and said : "" seek one for yourself when we are gone we will leave one behind us in the stable for you .",surprise
when they had gone forth he went into the stable and led the horse out; it was lame of one foot and limped hobblety jib hobblety jib; nevertheless he mounted it and rode away to the dark forest .,anger
that you shall have and still more than you ask for .,joy
then the wild man went back into the forest and it was not long before a stable boy came out of it who led a horse that snorted with its nostrils and could hardly be restrained and behind them followed a great troop of warriors entirely equipped in iron and their swords flashed in the sun .,joy
the youth made over his three legged horse to the stable boy mounted the other and rode at the head of the soldiers .,joy
"when he got near the battlefield a great part of the king "" s men had already fallen and little was wanting to make the rest give way .",sadness
then the youth galloped thither with his iron soldiers broke like a hurricane over the enemy and beat down all who opposed him .,anger
they began to flee but the youth pursued and never stopped until there was not a single man left .,joy
instead of returning to the king however he conducted his troop by byways back to the forest and called forth iron hans .,joy
all that he asked was done and soon he was riding on his three legged horse .,joy
when the king returned to his palace his daughter went to meet him and wished him joy of his victory .,joy
"the daughter wanted to hear who the strange knight was but the king did not know and said : "" he followed the enemy and i did not see him again .",surprise
"she inquired of the gardener where his boy was but he smiled and said : "" he has just come home on his threelegged horse and the others have been mocking him and crying : "" here comes our hobblety jib back again !",surprise
"so he said : "" i did the best of all and it would have gone badly without me .",anger
and then he was still more ridiculed .,anger
when the feast was announced the youth went out to the forest and called iron hans .,joy
"that i may catch the king "" s daughter "" s golden apple .",joy
"it is as safe as if you had it already "" said iron hans .",joy
you shall likewise have a suit of red armour for the occasion and ride on a spirited chestnut horse .,joy
when the day came the youth galloped to the spot took his place amongst the knights and was recognized by no one .,joy
"the king "" s daughter came forward and threw a golden apple to the knights but none of them caught it but he only as soon as he had it he galloped away .",joy
again he was the only one who caught the apple and he did not linger an instant but galloped off with it .,joy
"the king grew angry and said : "" that is not allowed; he must appear before me and tell his name .",anger
he gave the order that if the knight who caught the apple should go away again they should pursue him and if he would not come back willingly they were to cut him down and stab him .,anger
on the third day he received from iron hans a suit of black armour and a black horse and again he caught the apple .,joy
"but when he was riding off with it the king "" s attendants pursued him and one of them got so near him that he wounded the youth "" s leg with the point of his sword .",anger
"the youth nevertheless escaped from them but his horse leapt so violently that the helmet fell from the youth "" s head and they could see that he had golden hair .",joy
he is at work in the garden; the queer creature has been at the festival too and only came home yesterday evening; he has likewise shown my children three golden apples which he has won .,joy
"but the king "" s daughter went up to him and took it off and then his golden hair fell down over his shoulders and he was so handsome that all were amazed .",joy
"are you the knight who came every day to the festival always in different colours and who caught the three golden apples ? "" asked the king .",surprise
"yes "" answered he "" and here the apples are "" and he took them out of his pocket and returned them to the king .",joy
but i am likewise the knight who helped you to your victory over your enemies .,joy
"if you can perform such deeds as that you are no gardener "" s boy; tell me who is your father ?",surprise
my father is a mighty king and gold have i in plenty as great as i require .,joy
"i well see "" said the king "" that i owe my thanks to you; can i do anything to please you ?",surprise
"yes "" answered he "" that indeed you can .",joy
"the maiden laughed and said : "" he does not stand much on ceremony but i have already seen by his golden hair that he was no gardener "" s boy "" and then she went and kissed him .",joy
his father and mother came to the wedding and were in great delight for they had given up all hope of ever seeing their dear son again .,joy
and as they were sitting at the marriage feast the music suddenly stopped the doors opened and a stately king came in with a great retinue .,surprise
"he went up to the youth embraced him and said : "" i am iron hans and was by enchantment a wild man but you have set me free; all the treasures which i possess shall be your property .",joy
when any young man came within a hundred paces of her castle he became quite fixed and could not move a step till she came and set him free; which she would not do till he had given her his word never to come there again : but when any pretty maiden came within that space she was changed into a bird and the fairy put her into a cage and hung her up in a chamber in the castle .,anger
she was prettier than all the pretty girls that ever were seen before and a shepherd lad whose name was jorindel was very fond of her and they were soon to be married .,joy
it was a beautiful evening; the last rays of the setting sun shone bright through the long stems of the trees upon the green underwood beneath and the turtle doves sang from the tall birches .,joy
jorinda sat down to gaze upon the sun; jorindel sat by her side; and both felt sad they knew not why; but it seemed as if they were to be parted from one another for ever .,sadness
they had wandered a long way; and when they looked to see which way they should go home they found themselves at a loss to know what path to take .,sadness
the sun was setting fast and already half of its circle had sunk behind the hill : jorindel on a sudden looked behind him and saw through the bushes that they had without knowing it sat down close under the old walls of the castle .,surprise
the ring dove sang from the willow spray well a day !,joy
"he mourn "" d for the fate of his darling mate well a day !",sadness
jorindel turned to see the reason and beheld his jorinda changed into a nightingale so that her song ended with a mournful /jug jug/ .,surprise
and now the sun went quite down; the gloomy night came; the owl flew into a bush; and a moment after the old fairy came forth pale and meagre with staring eyes and a nose and chin that almost met one another .,anger
she mumbled something to herself seized the nightingale and went away with it in her hand .,anger
poor jorindel saw the nightingale was gone but what could he do ?,sadness
till the prisoner is fast and her doom is cast there stay !,anger
oh stay !,anger
when the charm is around her and the spell has bound her hie away ! away !,anger
on a sudden jorindel found himself free .,surprise
he prayed he wept he sorrowed but all in vain .,sadness
he could not go back to his own home so he went to a strange village and employed himself in keeping sheep .,sadness
many a time did he walk round and round as near to the hated castle as he dared go but all in vain; he heard or saw nothing of jorinda .,sadness
at last he dreamt one night that he found a beautiful purple flower and that in the middle of it lay a costly pearl; and he dreamt that he plucked the flower and went with it in his hand into the castle and that everything he touched with it was disenchanted and that there he found his jorinda again .,surprise
in the morning when he awoke he began to search over hill and dale for this pretty flower; and eight long days he sought for it in vain : but on the ninth day early in the morning he found the beautiful purple flower; and in the middle of it was a large dewdrop as big as a costly pearl .,joy
he walked nearer than a hundred paces to it and yet he did not become fixed as before but found that he could go quite close up to the door .,surprise
jorindel was very glad indeed to see this .,joy
then he touched the door with the flower and it sprang open; so that he went in through the court and listened when he heard so many birds singing .,surprise
when she saw jorindel she was very angry and screamed with rage; but she could not come within two yards of him for the flower he held in his hand was his safeguard .,anger
he ran or flew after her touched the cage with the flower and jorinda stood before him and threw her arms round his neck looking as beautiful as ever as beautiful as when they walked together in the wood .,joy
"then he touched all the other birds with the flower so that they all took their old forms again; and he took jorinda home where they were married and lived happily together many years : and so did a good many other lads whose maidens had been forced to sing in the old fairy "" s cages by themselves much longer than they liked .",joy
a great king of a land far away in the east had a daughter who was very beautiful but so proud and haughty and conceited that none of the princes who came to ask her in marriage was good enough for her and she only made sport of them .,anger
then the princess came in and as she passed by them she had something spiteful to say to every one .,anger
"the first was too fat : "" he "" s as round as a tub "" said she .",anger
"the next was too tall : "" what a maypole ! "" said she .",anger
"the next was too short : "" what a dumpling ! "" said she .",anger
"the fourth was too pale and she called him "" wallface .",anger
"the fifth was too red so she called him "" coxcomb .",anger
"the sixth was not straight enough; so she said he was like a green stick that had been laid to dry over a baker "" s oven .",anger
and thus she had some joke to crack upon every one : but she laughed more than all at a good king who was there .,anger
"look at him "" said she; "" his beard is like an old mop; he shall be called grisly beard .",anger
but the old king was very angry when he saw how his daughter behaved and how she ill treated all his guests; and he vowed that willing or unwilling she should marry the first man be he prince or beggar that came to the door .,anger
"then the king said "" you have sung so well that i will give you my daughter for your wife .",joy
so words and tears were of no avail; the parson was sent for and she was married to the fiddler .,sadness
"when this was over the king said "" now get ready to go you must not stay here you must travel on with your husband .",anger
"it belongs to king grisly beard "" answered he; "" hadst thou taken him all had been thine .",sadness
"ah ! unlucky wretch that i am ! "" sighed she; "" would that i had married king grisly beard !",anger
"whose are these beautiful green meadows ? "" said she .",surprise
they belong to king grisly beard hadst thou taken him they had all been thine .,sadness
"ah ! unlucky wretch that i am ! "" said she; "" would that i had married king grisly beard !",anger
"whose is this noble city ? "" said she .",surprise
it belongs to king grisly beard; hadst thou taken him it had all been thine .,sadness
"ah ! wretch that i am ! "" sighed she; "" why did i not marry king grisly beard ?",anger
"that is no business of mine "" said the fiddler : "" why should you wish for another husband ?",anger
am not i good enough for you ?,anger
"what a paltry place ! "" said she; "" to whom does that little dirty hole belong ?",surprise
"what do we want with servants ? "" said he; "" you must do for yourself whatever is to be done .",surprise
now make the fire and put on water and cook my supper for i am very tired .,anger
but the princess knew nothing of making fires and cooking and the fiddler was forced to help her .,anger
when they had eaten a very scanty meal they went to bed; but the fiddler called her up very early in the morning to clean the house .,anger
"thus they lived for two days : and when they had eaten up all there was in the cottage the man said "" wife we can "" t go on thus spending money and earning nothing .",anger
you must learn to weave baskets .,anger
then he went out and cut willows and brought them home and she began to weave; but it made her fingers very sore .,anger
"i see this work won "" t do "" said he : "" try and spin; perhaps you will do that better .",sadness
so she sat down and tried to spin; but the threads cut her tender fingers till the blood ran .,sadness
"see now "" said the fiddler "" you are good for nothing; you can do no work : what a bargain i have got !",anger
"however i "" ll try and set up a trade in pots and pans and you shall stand in the market and sell them .",anger
"alas ! "" sighed she "" if any of my father "" s court should pass by and see me standing in the market how they will laugh at me !",sadness
but her husband did not care for that and said she must work if she did not wish to die of hunger .,anger
at first the trade went well; for many people seeing such a beautiful woman went to buy her wares and paid their money without thinking of taking away the goods .,joy
they lived on this as long as it lasted; and then her husband bought a fresh lot of ware and she sat herself down with it in the corner of the market; but a drunken soldier soon came by and rode his horse against her stall and broke all her goods into a thousand pieces .,sadness
then she began to cry and knew not what to do .,sadness
"who would have thought you would have been so silly "" said he "" as to put an earthenware stall in the corner of the market where everybody passes ? but let us have no more crying; i see you are not fit for this sort of work so i have been to the king "" s palace and asked if they did not want a kitchen maid; and they say they will take you and there you will have plenty to eat .",anger
thus the princess became a kitchen maid and helped the cook to do all the dirtiest work; but she was allowed to carry home some of the meat that was left and on this they lived .,sadness
"she had not been there long before she heard that the king "" s eldest son was passing by going to be married; and she went to one of the windows and looked out .",surprise
everything was ready and all the pomp and brightness of the court was there .,joy
then she bitterly grieved for the pride and folly which had brought her so low .,sadness
and the servants gave her some of the rich meats which she put into her basket to take home .,joy
then everybody laughed and jeered at her; and she was so abashed that she wished herself a thousand feet deep in the earth .,sadness
i am the fiddler who has lived with you in the hut .,joy
i brought you there because i really loved you .,joy
i am also the soldier that overset your stall .,joy
i have done all this only to cure you of your silly pride and to show you the folly of your ill treatment of me .,joy
now all is over : you have learnt wisdom and it is time to hold our marriage feast .,joy
then the chamberlains came and brought her the most beautiful robes; and her father and his whole court were there already and welcomed her home on her marriage .,joy
joy was in every face and every heart .,joy
the feast was grand; they danced and sang; all were merry; and i only wish that you and i had been of the party .,joy
and when the time came for him to go home he had bought pearls and jewels for the two eldest but he had sought everywhere in vain for the rose; and when he went into any garden and asked for such a thing the people laughed at him and asked him whether he thought roses grew in snow .,sadness
this grieved him very much for lily was his dearest child; and as he was journeying home thinking what he should bring her he came to a fine castle; and around the castle was a garden in one half of which it seemed to be summer time and in the other half winter .,sadness
"a lucky hit ! "" said he as he called to his servant and told him to go to a beautiful bed of roses that was there and bring him away one of the finest flowers .",joy
"this done they were riding away well pleased when up sprang a fierce lion and roared out "" whoever has stolen my roses shall be eaten up alive !",anger
"no ! "" said the lion "" nothing unless you undertake to give me whatever meets you on your return home; if you agree to this i will give you your life and the rose too for your daughter .",anger
and at last the man yielded with a heavy heart and took the rose; and said he would give the lion whatever should meet him first on his return .,sadness
and as he came near home it was lily his youngest and dearest daughter that met him; she came running and kissed him and welcomed him home; and when she saw that he had brought her the rose she was still more glad .,joy
"but her father began to be very sorrowful and to weep saying "" alas my dearest child !",sadness
i have bought this flower at a high price for i have said i would give you to a wild lion; and when he has you he will tear you in pieces and eat you .,sadness
the next morning she asked the way she was to go and took leave of her father and went forth with a bold heart into the wood .,joy
but the lion was an enchanted prince .,surprise
and when lily came to the castle he welcomed her so courteously that she agreed to marry him .,joy
the wedding feast was held and they lived happily together a long time .,joy
"after some time he said to her "" tomorrow there will be a great feast in your father "" s house for your eldest sister is to be married; and if you wish to go and visit her my lions shall lead you thither .",joy
then she rejoiced much at the thoughts of seeing her father once more and set out with the lions; and everyone was overjoyed to see her for they had thought her dead long since .,joy
but she told them how happy she was and stayed till the feast was over and then went back to the wood .,joy
however she gave him no rest and said she would take care no light should fall upon him .,anger
"in a moment he disappeared and when his wife came in and looked for him she found only a white dove; and it said to her "" seven years must i fly up and down over the face of the earth but every now and then i will let fall a white feather that will show you the way i am going; follow it and at last you may overtake and set me free .",sadness
this said he flew out at the door and poor lily followed; and every now and then a white feather fell and showed her the way she was to journey .,sadness
thus she went roving on through the wide world and looked neither to the right hand nor to the left nor took any rest for seven years .,sadness
then she began to be glad and thought to herself that the time was fast coming when all her troubles should end; yet repose was still far off for one day as she was travelling on she missed the white feather and when she lifted up her eyes she could nowhere see the dove .,joy
"now "" thought she to herself "" no aid of man can be of use to me .",sadness
"so she thanked the sun and went on her way till eventide; and when the moon arose she cried unto it and said "" thou shinest through the night over field and grove hast thou nowhere seen my white dove ?",sadness
go to the red sea; on the right shore stand many rods count them and when thou comest to the eleventh break it off and smite the dragon with it; and so the lion will have the victory and both of them will appear to you in their own forms .,joy
then look round and thou wilt see a griffin winged like bird sitting by the red sea; jump on to his back with thy beloved one as quickly as possible and he will carry you over the waters to your home .,joy
"but no sooner was the princess released from the spell than she seized the prince by the arm and sprang on to the griffin "" s back and went off carrying the prince away with her .",surprise
"thus the unhappy traveller was again forsaken and forlorn; but she took heart and said "" as far as the wind blows and so long as the cock crows i will journey on till i find him once again .",sadness
so she put it on and went into the palace and all the people gazed upon her; and the dress pleased the bride so much that she asked whether it was to be sold .,joy
wilt thou then forget me quite ?,sadness
then poor lily was led away and forced to give up the golden dress; and when she saw that there was no help for her she went out into a meadow and sat herself down and wept .,sadness
"but as she sat she bethought herself of the egg that the moon had given her; and when she broke it there ran out a hen and twelve chickens of pure gold that played about and then nestled under the old one "" s wings so as to form the most beautiful sight in the world .",joy
and she rose up and drove them before her till the bride saw them from her window and was so pleased that she came forth and asked her if she would sell the brood .,joy
"then the prince took care to throw away the sleeping draught; and when lily came and began again to tell him what woes had befallen her and how faithful and true to him she had been he knew his beloved wife "" s voice and sprang up and said "" you have awakened me as from a dream for the strange princess had thrown a spell around me so that i had altogether forgotten you; but heaven hath sent you to me in a lucky hour .",joy
there they found their child now grown up to be comely and fair; and after all their troubles they lived happily together to the end of their days .,joy
once upon a time there was a dear little girl who was loved by everyone who looked at her but most of all by her grandmother and there was nothing that she would not have given to the child .,joy
"one day her mother said to her : "" come little red cap here is a piece of cake and a bottle of wine; take them to your grandmother she is ill and weak and they will do her good .",sadness
"i will take great care "" said little red cap to her mother and gave her hand on it .",joy
red cap did not know what a wicked creature he was and was not at all afraid of him .,joy
"the wolf thought to himself : "" what a tender young creature ! what a nice plump mouthful she will be better to eat than the old woman .",joy
i must act craftily so as to catch both .,joy
i believe too that you do not hear how sweetly the little birds are singing; you walk gravely along as if you were going to school while everything else out here in the wood is merry .,joy
"it is so early in the day that i shall still get there in good time "" ; and so she ran from the path into the wood to look for flowers .",joy
and whenever she had picked one she fancied that she saw a still prettier one farther on and ran after it and so got deeper and deeper into the wood .,joy
"lift the latch "" called out the grandmother "" i am too weak and cannot get up .",sadness
"oh ! grandmother "" she said "" what big ears you have !",surprise
"but grandmother what big eyes you have ! "" she said .",surprise
but grandmother what large hands you have !,surprise
when the wolf had appeased his appetite he lay down again in the bed fell asleep and began to snore very loud .,joy
"do i find you here you old sinner ! "" said he .",surprise
i have long sought you !,surprise
then just as he was going to fire at him it occurred to him that the wolf might have devoured the grandmother and that she might still be saved so he did not fire but took a pair of scissors and began to cut open the stomach of the sleeping wolf .,surprise
"red cap however quickly fetched great stones with which they filled the wolf "" s belly and when he awoke he wanted to run away but the stones were so heavy that he collapsed at once and fell dead .",surprise
then all three were delighted .,joy
"the huntsman drew off the wolf "" s skin and went home with it; the grandmother ate the cake and drank the wine which red cap had brought and revived but red cap thought to herself : "" as long as i live i will never by myself leave the path to run into the wood when my mother has forbidden me to do so .",joy
but red cap went joyously home and no one ever did anything to harm her again .,joy
the mother however loved the ugly and lazy one best because she was her own daughter and so the other who was only her stepdaughter was made to do all the work of the house and was quite the cinderella of the family .,joy
"she ran home crying to tell of her misfortune but her stepmother spoke harshly to her and after giving her a violent scolding said unkindly "" as you have let the spindle fall into the well you may go yourself and fetch it out .",sadness
then she carefully gathered the apples together in a heap and walked on again .,joy
the old woman spoke so kindly that the girl summoned up courage and agreed to enter into her service .,joy
the old woman was as good as her word : she never spoke angrily to her and gave her roast and boiled meats every day .,joy
so she stayed on with mother holle for some time and then she began to grow unhappy .,sadness
she could not at first tell why she felt sad but she became conscious at last of great longing to go home; then she knew she was homesick although she was a thousand times better off with mother holle than with her mother and sister .,sadness
"after waiting awhile she went to mother holle and said "" i am so homesick that i cannot stay with you any longer for although i am so happy here i must return to my own people .",sadness
"then mother holle said "" i am pleased that you should want to go back to your own people and as you have served me so well and faithfully i will take you home myself .",joy
then she went in to her mother and sister and as she was so richly covered with gold they gave her a warm welcome .,joy
she related to them all that had happened and when the mother heard how she had come by her great riches she thought she should like her ugly lazy daughter to go and try her fortune .,joy
"but the lazy girl answered "" do you think i am going to dirty my hands for you ? "" and walked on .",anger
"but she only answered "" a nice thing to ask me to do one of the apples might fall on my head "" and passed on .",anger
"at last she came to mother holle "" s house and as she had heard all about the large teeth from her sister she was not afraid of them and engaged herself without delay to the old woman .",joy
the first day she was very obedient and industrious and exerted herself to please mother holle for she thought of the gold she should get in return .,joy
the next day however she began to dawdle over her work and the third day she was more idle still; then she began to lie in bed in the mornings and refused to get up .,anger
"worse still she neglected to make the old woman "" s bed properly and forgot to shake it so that the feathers might fly about .",anger
so mother holle very soon got tired of her and told her she might go .,anger
"the lazy girl was delighted at this and thought to herself "" the gold will soon be mine .",joy
"that is in return for your services "" said the old woman and she shut the gate .",anger
"your dirty daughter "" s come back to you .",anger
but try what she would she could not get the pitch off and it stuck to her as long as she lived .,sadness
"but his wife said "" pray let the poor faithful creature live; he has served us well a great many years and we ought to give him a livelihood for the rest of his days .",sadness
"but what can we do with him ? "" said the shepherd "" he has not a tooth in his head and the thieves don "" t care for him at all; to be sure he has served us but then he did it to earn his livelihood; tomorrow shall be his last day depend upon it .",anger
the dog liked this plan very well; and accordingly so it was managed .,joy
"then the shepherd patted him on the head and said "" old sultan has saved our child from the wolf and therefore he shall live and be well taken care of and have plenty to eat .",joy
so from this time forward sultan had all that he could wish for .,joy
"no "" said the sultan; "" i will be true to my master .",anger
"then the wolf was very angry and called sultan "" an old rogue "" and swore he would have his revenge .",anger
so the next morning the wolf sent the boar to challenge sultan to come into the wood to fight the matter .,anger
sultan and the cat soon came up and looked about and wondered that no one was there .,surprise
"the boar however had not quite hidden himself for his ears stuck out of the bush; and when he shook one of them a little the cat seeing something move and thinking it was a mouse sprang upon it and bit and scratched it so that the boar jumped up and grunted and ran away roaring out "" look up in the tree there sits the one who is to blame .",anger
so they looked up and espied the wolf sitting amongst the branches; and they called him a cowardly rascal and would not suffer him to come down till he was heartily ashamed of himself and had promised to be good friends again with old sultan .,anger
at length the woman hoped that god was about to grant her desire .,sadness
one day the woman was standing by this window and looking down into the garden when she saw a bed which was planted with the most beautiful rampion ( rapunzel ) and it looked so fresh and green that she longed for it she quite pined away and began to look pale and miserable .,sadness
"ah "" she replied "" if i can "" t eat some of the rampion which is in the garden behind our house i shall die .",sadness
she at once made herself a salad of it and ate it greedily .,joy
it tasted so good to her so very good that the next day she longed for it three times as much as before .,sadness
if he was to have any rest her husband must once more descend into the garden .,anger
"how can you dare "" said she with angry look "" descend into my garden and steal my rampion like a thief ?",anger
you shall suffer for it !,anger
"then the enchantress allowed her anger to be softened and said to him : "" if the case be as you say i will allow you to take away with you as much rampion as you will only i make one condition you must give me the child which your wife will bring into the world; it shall be well treated and i will care for it like a mother .",anger
when she was twelve years old the enchantress shut her into a tower which lay in a forest and had neither stairs nor door but quite at the top was a little window .,surprise
then he heard a song which was so charming that he stood still and listened .,joy
"the king "" s son wanted to climb up to her and looked for the door of the tower but none was to be found .",sadness
he rode home but the singing had so deeply touched his heart that every day he went out into the forest and listened to it .,joy
"if that is the ladder by which one mounts i too will try my fortune "" said he and the next day when it began to grow dark he went to the tower and cried :",surprise
"then rapunzel lost her fear and when he asked her if she would take him for her husband and she saw that he was young and handsome she thought : "" he will love me more than old dame gothel does "" ; and she said yes and laid her hand in his .",joy
"she said : "" i will willingly go away with you but i do not know how to get down .",joy
bring with you a skein of silk every time that you come and i will weave a ladder with it and when that is ready i will descend and you will take me on your horse .,joy
"the enchantress remarked nothing of this until once rapunzel said to her : "" tell me dame gothel how it happens that you are so much heavier for me to draw up than the young king "" s son he is with me in a moment .",surprise
"ah ! you wicked child "" cried the enchantress .",anger
what do i hear you say !,anger
i thought i had separated you from all the world and yet you have deceived me !,anger
"in her anger she clutched rapunzel "" s beautiful tresses wrapped them twice round her left hand seized a pair of scissors with the right and snip snap they were cut off and the lovely braids lay on the ground .",surprise
and she was so pitiless that she took poor rapunzel into a desert where she had to live in great grief and misery .,anger
"aha ! "" she cried mockingly "" you would fetch your dearest but the beautiful bird sits no longer singing in the nest; the cat has got it and will scratch out your eyes as well .",anger
rapunzel is lost to you; you will never see her again .,anger
"the king "" s son was beside himself with pain and in his despair he leapt down from the tower .",sadness
he escaped with his life but the thorns into which he fell pierced his eyes .,sadness
then he wandered quite blind about the forest ate nothing but roots and berries and did naught but lament and weep over the loss of his dearest wife .,sadness
thus he roamed about in misery for some years and at length came to the desert where rapunzel with the twins to which she had given birth a boy and a girl lived in wretchedness .,sadness
he heard a voice and it seemed so familiar to him that he went towards it and when he approached rapunzel knew him and fell on his neck and wept .,surprise
two of her tears wetted his eyes and they grew clear again and he could see with them as before .,joy
he led her to his kingdom where he was joyfully received and they lived for a long time afterwards happy and contented .,joy
"now this king was very fond of money; and when he heard the miller "" s boast his greediness was raised and he sent for the girl to be brought before him .",surprise
it was in vain that the poor maiden said that it was only a silly boast of her father for that she could do no such thing as spin straw into gold : the chamber door was locked and she was left alone .,sadness
"she sat down in one corner of the room and began to bewail her hard fate; when on a sudden the door opened and a droll looking little man hobbled in and said "" good morrow to you my good lass; what are you weeping for ?",sadness
"alas ! "" said she "" i must spin this straw into gold and i know not how .",sadness
and round about the wheel went merrily; the work was quickly done and the straw was all spun into gold .,joy
"when the king came and saw this he was greatly astonished and pleased; but his heart grew still more greedy of gain and he shut up the poor miller "" s daughter again with a fresh task .",joy
"then she knew not what to do and sat down once more to weep; but the dwarf soon opened the door and said "" what will you give me to do your task ?",sadness
"the king was greatly delighted to see all this glittering treasure; but still he had not enough : so he took the miller "" s daughter to a yet larger heap and said "" all this must be spun tonight; and if it is you shall be my queen .",joy
"i have nothing left "" said she .",sadness
"then say you will give me "" said the little man "" the first little child that you may have when you are queen .",surprise
"that may never be "" thought the miller "" s daughter : and as she knew no other way to get her task done she said she would do what he asked .",sadness
round went the wheel again to the old song and the manikin once more spun the heap into gold .,joy
"the king came in the morning and finding all he wanted was forced to keep his word; so he married the miller "" s daughter and she really became queen .",joy
at the birth of her first little child she was very glad and forgot the dwarf and what she had said .,joy
but one day he came into her room where she was sitting playing with her baby and put her in mind of it .,surprise
"then she grieved sorely at her misfortune and said she would give him all the wealth of the kingdom if he would let her off but in vain; till at last her tears softened him and he said "" i will give you three days "" grace and if during that time you tell me my name you shall keep your child .",sadness
"the next day the little man came and she began with timothy ichabod benjamin jeremiah and all the names she could remember; but to all and each of them he said "" madam that is not my name .",surprise
"the second day she began with all the comical names she could hear of bandy legs hunchback crook shanks and so on; but the little gentleman still said to every one of them "" madam that is not my name .",surprise
"merrily the feast i "" ll make .",joy
"today i "" ll brew tomorrow bake; merrily i "" ll dance and sing for next day will a stranger bring .",joy
little does my lady dream rumpelstiltskin is my name !,joy
when the queen heard this she jumped for joy and as soon as her little friend came she sat down upon her throne and called all her court round to enjoy the fun; and the nurse stood by her side with the baby in her arms as if it was quite ready to be given up .,joy
"then the little man began to chuckle at the thought of having the poor child to take home with him to his hut in the woods; and he cried out "" now lady what is my name ?",joy
"can your name be rumpelstiltskin ? "" said the lady slyly .",joy
"some witch told you that ! some witch told you that ! "" cried the little man and dashed his right foot in a rage so deep into the floor that he was forced to lay hold of it with both hands to pull it out .",anger
"then he made the best of his way off while the nurse laughed and the baby crowed; and all the court jeered at him for having had so much trouble for nothing and said "" we wish you a very good morning and a merry feast mr rumplestiltskin !",joy
good day mrs cat of kehrewit how comes it that alone you sit ?,joy
"in milk i "" m breaking bread so sweet will you be my guest and eat ?",joy
is mrs fox not at home ?,surprise
she sits upstairs in her room bewailing her sorrowful doom bewailing her trouble so sore for old mr fox is no more .,sadness
"mrs fox asked : "" has the gentleman red stockings on and has he a pointed mouth ?",surprise
"then he won "" t do for me .",anger
but one of the good qualities which old mr fox had possessed was always lacking and the cat had continually to send the suitors away .,sadness
"then mrs fox said : "" has the gentleman red stockings on and has a little pointed mouth ?",surprise
"yes "" said the cat "" he has .",joy
"then let him come upstairs "" said mrs fox and ordered the servant to prepare the wedding feast .",joy
sweep me the room as clean as you can up with the window fling out my old man !,joy
for many a fine fat mouse he brought yet of his wife he never thought but ate up every one he caught .,joy
then the wedding was solemnized with young mr fox and there was much rejoicing and dancing; and if they have not left off they are dancing still .,joy
the frame of the window was made of fine black ebony and as she sat looking out upon the snow she pricked her finger and three drops of blood fell upon it .,sadness
"then she gazed thoughtfully upon the red drops that sprinkled the white snow and said "" would that my little daughter may be as white as that snow as red as that blood and as black as this ebony windowframe !",sadness
but this queen died; and the king soon married another wife who became queen and was very beautiful but so vain that she could not bear to think that anyone could be handsomer than she was .,joy
thou queen art the fairest in all the land .,joy
but snowdrop grew more and more beautiful; and when she was seven years old she was as bright as the day and fairer than the queen herself .,joy
thou queen art fair and beauteous to see but snowdrop is lovelier far than thee !,anger
"when she heard this she turned pale with rage and envy and called to one of her servants and said "" take snowdrop away into the wide wood that i may never see her any more .",anger
"then the servant led her away; but his heart melted when snowdrop begged him to spare her life and he said "" i will not hurt you thou pretty child .",sadness
so she tried all the little beds; but one was too long and another was too short till at last the seventh suited her : and there she laid herself down and went to sleep .,joy
"the first said "" who has been sitting on my stool ?",anger
"the second "" who has been eating off my plate ?",anger
"the third "" who has been picking my bread ?",anger
"the fourth "" who has been meddling with my spoon ?",anger
"the fifth "" who has been handling my fork ?",anger
"the sixth "" who has been cutting with my knife ?",anger
"the seventh "" who has been drinking my wine ?",anger
"then the first looked round and said "" who has been lying on my bed ?",anger
and the rest came running to him and everyone cried out that somebody had been upon his bed .,anger
"but the seventh saw snowdrop and called all his brethren to come and see her; and they cried out with wonder and astonishment and brought their lamps to look at her and said "" good heavens ! what a lovely child she is !",surprise
and they were very glad to see her and took care not to wake her; and the seventh dwarf slept an hour with each of the other dwarfs in turn till the night was gone .,joy
in the morning snowdrop told them all her story; and they pitied her and said if she would keep all things in order and cook and wash and knit and spin for them she might stay where she was and they would take good care of her .,sadness
thou queen art the fairest in all this land : but over the hills in the greenwood shade where the seven dwarfs their dwelling have made there snowdrop is hiding her head; and she is lovelier far o queen ! than thee .,anger
and she could not bear to think that anyone lived who was more beautiful than she was; so she dressed herself up as an old pedlar and went her way over the hills to the place where the dwarfs dwelt .,anger
"i will let the old lady in; she seems to be a very good sort of body "" thought snowdrop as she ran down and unbolted the door .",joy
"snowdrop did not dream of any mischief; so she stood before the old woman; but she set to work so nimbly and pulled the lace so tight that snowdrop "" s breath was stopped and she fell down as if she were dead .",surprise
"there "" s an end to all thy beauty "" said the spiteful queen and went away home .",anger
in the evening the seven dwarfs came home; and i need not say how grieved they were to see their faithful snowdrop stretched out upon the ground as if she was quite dead .,sadness
however they lifted her up and when they found what ailed her they cut the lace; and in a little time she began to breathe and very soon came to life again .,joy
"then they said "" the old woman was the queen herself; take care another time and let no one in when we are away .",anger
when the queen got home she went straight to her glass and spoke to it as before; but to her great grief it still said :,anger
thou queen art the fairest in all this land : but over the hills in the greenwood shade where the seven dwarfs their dwelling have made there snowdrop is hiding her head; and she is lovelier far o queen ! than thee .,anger
then the blood ran cold in her heart with spite and malice to see that snowdrop still lived; and she dressed herself up again but in quite another dress from the one she wore before and took with her a poisoned comb .,anger
"when she reached the dwarfs "" cottage she knocked at the door and cried "" fine wares to sell !",anger
and it looked so pretty that she took it up and put it into her hair to try it; but the moment it touched her head the poison was so powerful that she fell down senseless .,surprise
"there you may lie "" said the queen and went her way .",joy
"meantime the queen went home to her glass and shook with rage when she read the very same answer as before; and she said "" snowdrop shall die if it cost me my life .",anger
so she went by herself into her chamber and got ready a poisoned apple : the outside looked very rosy and tempting but whoever tasted it was sure to die .,anger
"you silly girl ! "" answered the other "" what are you afraid of ?",anger
do you think it is poisoned ?,anger
come ! do you eat one part and i will eat the other .,anger
but she had scarcely put the piece into her mouth when she fell down dead upon the ground .,sadness
"this time nothing will save thee "" said the queen; and she went home to her glass and at last it said :",joy
thou queen art the fairest of all the fair .,joy
and then her wicked heart was glad and as happy as such a heart could be .,joy
they lifted her up and combed her hair and washed her face with wine and water; but all was in vain for the little girl seemed quite dead .,sadness
"so they laid her down upon a bier and all seven watched and bewailed her three whole days; and then they thought they would bury her : but her cheeks were still rosy; and her face looked just as it did while she was alive; so they said "" we will never bury her in the cold ground .",sadness
"and they made a coffin of glass so that they might still look at her and wrote upon it in golden letters what her name was and that she was a king "" s daughter .",sadness
and the coffin was set among the hills and one of the dwarfs always sat by it and watched .,sadness
and the birds of the air came too and bemoaned snowdrop; and first of all came an owl and then a raven and at last a dove and sat by her side .,sadness
"at last a prince came and called at the dwarfs "" house; and he saw snowdrop and read what was written in golden letters .",surprise
"then he offered the dwarfs money and prayed and besought them to let him take her away; but they said "" we will not part with her for all the gold in the world .",sadness
"at last however they had pity on him and gave him the coffin; but the moment he lifted it up to carry it home with him the piece of apple fell from between her lips and snowdrop awoke and said "" where am i ?",surprise
"and the prince said "" thou art quite safe with me .",joy
"then he told her all that had happened and said "" i love you far better than all the world; so come with me to my father "" s palace and you shall be my wife .",joy
and snowdrop consented and went home with the prince; and everything was got ready with great pomp and splendour for their wedding .,joy
when she heard this she started with rage; but her envy and curiosity were so great that she could not help setting out to see the bride .,anger
and when she got there and saw that it was no other than snowdrop who as she thought had been dead a long while she choked with rage and fell down and died : but snowdrop and the prince lived and reigned happily over that land many many years; and sometimes they went up into the mountains and paid a visit to the little dwarfs who had been so kind to snowdrop in her time of need .,joy
the stepdaughter once had a pretty apron which the other fancied so much that she became envious and told her mother that she must and would have that apron .,anger
"be quiet my child "" said the old woman "" and you shall have it .",anger
your stepsister has long deserved death; tonight when she is asleep i will come and cut her head off .,anger
"then the witch cried : "" where are you ?",anger
"the old woman went out but saw no one on the stairs and cried again : "" where are you ?",anger
her own child whose head she had cut off bathed in her blood .,anger
the witch fell into a passion sprang to the window and as she could look forth quite far into the world she perceived her stepdaughter hurrying away with her sweetheart roland .,anger
"that shall not help you "" cried she "" even if you have got a long way off you shall still not escape me .",anger
"she put on her many league boots in which she covered an hour "" s walk at every step and it was not long before she overtook them .",anger
the witch placed herself on the shore threw breadcrumbs in and went to endless trouble to entice the duck; but the duck did not let herself be enticed and the old woman had to go home at night as she had come .,anger
"it was not long before the witch came striding up towards them and said to the musician : "" dear musician may i pluck that beautiful flower for myself ?",anger
as she was hastily creeping into the hedge and was just going to pluck the flower knowing perfectly well who the flower was he began to play and whether she would or not she was forced to dance for it was a magical dance .,anger
the faster he played the more violent springs was she forced to make and the thorns tore her clothes from her body and pricked her and wounded her till she bled and as he did not stop she had to dance till she lay dead on the ground .,anger
"as they were now set free roland said : "" now i will go to my father and arrange for the wedding .",joy
"then in the meantime i will stay here and wait for you "" said the girl "" and that no one may recognize me i will change myself into a red stone landmark .",joy
but when roland got home he fell into the snares of another who so fascinated him that he forgot the maiden .,joy
"the poor girl remained there a long time but at length as he did not return at all she was sad and changed herself into a flower and thought : "" someone will surely come this way and trample me down .",sadness
when he arose in the morning all the work was already done the room was swept the table and benches cleaned the fire in the hearth was lighted and the water was fetched and at noon when he came home the table was laid and a good dinner served .,surprise
he could not conceive how this came to pass for he never saw a human being in his house and no one could have concealed himself in it .,surprise
instantly the transformation came to an end and a beautiful girl stood before him who admitted to him that she had been the flower and that up to this time she had attended to his house keeping .,surprise
"she told him her story and as she pleased him he asked her if she would marry him but she answered : "" no "" for she wanted to remain faithful to her sweetheart roland although he had deserted her .",sadness
nevertheless she promised not to go away but to continue keeping house for the shepherd .,sadness
"and now the time drew near when roland "" s wedding was to be celebrated and then according to an old custom in the country it was announced that all the girls were to be present at it and sing in honour of the bridal pair .",joy
when the faithful maiden heard of this she grew so sad that she thought her heart would break and she would not go thither but the other girls came and took her .,sadness
when it came to her turn to sing she stepped back until at last she was the only one left and then she could not refuse .,sadness
"but when she began her song and it reached roland "" s ears he sprang up and cried : "" i know the voice that is the true bride i will have no other !",surprise
everything he had forgotten and which had vanished from his mind had suddenly come home again to his heart .,surprise
then the faithful maiden held her wedding with her sweetheart roland and grief came to an end and joy began .,joy
"with all my heart "" said partlet "" let us go and make a holiday of it together .",joy
"that "" s a good joke ! "" said chanticleer; "" no that will never do; i had rather by half walk home; i "" ll sit on the box and be coachman if you like but i "" ll not draw .",surprise
"while this was passing a duck came quacking up and cried out "" you thieving vagabonds what business have you in my grounds ?",anger
"i "" ll give it you well for your insolence ! "" and upon that she fell upon chanticleer most lustily .",anger
"after they had travelled along a little way they met a needle and a pin walking together along the road : and the needle cried out "" stop stop ! "" and said it was so dark that they could hardly find their way and such dirty walking they could not get on at all : he told them that he and his friend the pin had been at a public house a few miles off and had sat drinking till they had forgotten how late it was; he begged therefore that the travellers would be so kind as to give them a lift in their carriage .",surprise
"bless me ! "" said he "" all the world seems to have a design against my head this morning "" : and so saying he threw himself sulkily into his easy chair; but oh dear ! the needle ran into him; and this time the pain was not in his head .",anger
he now flew into a very great passion and suspecting the company who had come in the night before he went to look after them but they were all off; so he swore that he never again would take in such a troop of vagabonds who ate a great deal paid no reckoning and gave him nothing for his trouble but their apish tricks .,anger
then he was very angry and went without his supper to bed; but when he laid his head on the pillow the pin ran into his cheek : at this he became quite furious and jumping up would have run out of the house; but when he came to the door the millstone fell down on his head and killed him on the spot .,anger
then chanticleer was very sorry and cried bitterly; and all the beasts came and wept with him over poor partlet .,sadness
then a stone who saw what had happened came up and kindly offered to help poor chanticleer by laying himself across the stream; and this time he got safely to the other side with the hearse and managed to get partlet out of it; but the fox and the other mourners who were sitting behind were too heavy and fell back into the water and were all carried away by the stream and drowned .,sadness
then he sat down by the grave and wept and mourned till at last he died too; and so all were dead .,sadness
there was once upon a time a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully but when the war came to an end could serve no longer because of the many wounds which he had received .,sadness
then the soldier did not know how to earn a living went away greatly troubled and walked the whole day until in the evening he entered a forest .,sadness
"oho ! "" she answered "" who gives anything to a run away soldier ?",anger
he found the blue light and made her a signal to draw him up again .,joy
the witch fell into a passion let him fall again into the well and went away .,anger
he sat for a while very sorrowfully then suddenly he felt in his pocket and found his tobacco pipe which was still half full .,sadness
"this shall be my last pleasure "" thought he pulled it out lit it at the blue light and began to smoke .",sadness
"when the smoke had circled about the cavern suddenly a little black dwarf stood before him and said : "" lord what are your commands ?",surprise
"what my commands are ? "" replied the soldier quite astonished .",surprise
"good "" said the soldier; "" then in the first place help me out of this well .",joy
on the way the dwarf showed him the treasures which the witch had collected and hidden there and the soldier took as much gold as he could carry .,joy
"when he was above he said to the little man : "" now go and bind the old witch and carry her before the judge .",joy
"it is all done "" said he "" and the witch is already hanging on the gallows .",joy
"at this moment none "" answered the soldier; "" you can return home only be at hand immediately if i summon you .",joy
thereupon he vanished from his sight .,surprise
the soldier returned to the town from which he come .,joy
he went to the best inn ordered himself handsome clothes and then bade the landlord furnish him a room as handsome as possible .,joy
"when it was ready and the soldier had taken possession of it he summoned the little black manikin and said : "" i have served the king faithfully but he has dismissed me and left me to hunger and now i want to take my revenge .",anger
"late at night when the king "" s daughter is in bed bring her here in her sleep she shall do servant "" s work for me .",anger
"aha ! are you there ? "" cried the soldier "" get to your work at once !",anger
fetch the broom and sweep the chamber .,anger
"when she had done this he ordered her to come to his chair and then he stretched out his feet and said : "" pull off my boots "" and then he threw them in her face and made her pick them up again and clean and brighten them .",anger
she however did everything he bade her without opposition silently and with halfshut eyes .,sadness
"do what i bid you "" replied the soldier and again this third night the princess was obliged to work like a servant but before she went away she hid her shoe under the bed .",anger
and now loaded with chains he was standing at the window of his dungeon when he chanced to see one of his comrades passing by .,surprise
"the soldier tapped at the pane of glass and when this man came up said to him : "" be so kind as to fetch me the small bundle i have left lying in the inn and i will give you a ducat for doing it .",surprise
his comrade ran thither and brought him what he wanted .,joy
as soon as the soldier was alone again he lighted his pipe and summoned the black manikin .,joy
"have no fear "" said the latter to his master .",joy
go wheresoever they take you and let them do what they will only take the blue light with you .,joy
"what is it ? "" asked the king .",anger
"you may smoke three "" answered the king "" but do not imagine that i will spare your life .",anger
strike down to earth that false judge there and his constable and spare not the king who has treated me so ill .,anger
then the manikin fell on them like lightning darting this way and that way and whosoever was so much as touched by his cudgel fell to earth and did not venture to stir again .,anger
"a shepherd "" s dog had a master who took no care of him but often let him suffer the greatest hunger .",sadness
at last he could bear it no longer; so he took to his heels and off he ran in a very sad and sorrowful mood .,sadness
"on the road he met a sparrow that said to him "" why are you so sad my friend ?",sadness
"because "" said the dog "" i am very very hungry and have nothing to eat .",sadness
then the dog snapped it up and scrambled away with it into a corner where he soon ate it all up .,joy
"when the dog had eaten this too the sparrow said to him "" well my good friend have you had enough now ?",joy
"i have had plenty of meat "" answered he "" but i should like to have a piece of bread to eat after it .",joy
"come with me then "" said the sparrow "" and you shall soon have that too .",joy
"yes "" said he; "" and now let us take a walk a little way out of the town .",joy
mr carter or it shall be the worse for you .,anger
"but the carter grumbling to himself "" you make it the worse for me indeed ! what can you do ? "" cracked his whip and drove his cart over the poor dog so that the wheels crushed him to death .",anger
"there "" cried the sparrow "" thou cruel villain thou hast killed my friend the dog .",anger
now mind what i say .,anger
this deed of thine shall cost thee all thou art worth .,anger
"do your worst and welcome "" said the brute "" what harm can you do me ? "" and passed on .",anger
at last he looked round and saw that the cart was dripping and the cask quite empty .,surprise
"what an unlucky wretch i am ! "" cried he .",anger
"not wretch enough yet ! "" said the sparrow as she alighted upon the head of one of the horses and pecked at him till he reared up and kicked .",anger
"when the carter saw this he drew out his hatchet and aimed a blow at the sparrow meaning to kill her; but she flew away and the blow fell upon the poor horse "" s head with such force that he fell down dead .",surprise
"unlucky wretch that i am ! "" cried he .",anger
"not wretch enough yet ! "" said the sparrow .",anger
"when the carter saw this he again cried out "" miserable wretch that i am !",anger
"but the sparrow answered "" not wretch enough yet ! "" and perched on the head of the second horse and pecked at him too .",anger
the carter ran up and struck at her again with his hatchet; but away she flew and the blow fell upon the second horse and killed him on the spot .,surprise
"unlucky wretch that i am ! "" said he .",anger
"not wretch enough yet ! "" said the sparrow; and perching upon the third horse she began to peck him too .",anger
the carter was mad with fury; and without looking about him or caring what he was about struck again at the sparrow; but killed his third horse as he done the other two .,anger
"alas ! miserable wretch that i am ! "" cried he .",anger
"not wretch enough yet ! "" answered the sparrow as she flew away; "" now will i plague and punish thee at thy own house .",anger
the carter was forced at last to leave his cart behind him and to go home overflowing with rage and vexation .,anger
"alas ! "" said he to his wife "" what ill luck has befallen me ! my wine is all spilt and my horses all three dead .",anger
"alas ! husband "" replied she "" and a wicked bird has come into the house and has brought with her all the birds in the world i am sure and they have fallen upon our corn in the loft and are eating it up at such a rate !",anger
away ran the husband upstairs and saw thousands of birds sitting upon the floor eating up his corn with the sparrow in the midst of them .,surprise
"unlucky wretch that i am ! "" cried the carter; for he saw that the corn was almost all gone .",anger
"not wretch enough yet ! "" said the sparrow; "" thy cruelty shall cost thee they life yet ! "" and away she flew .",anger
the carter seeing that he had thus lost all that he had went down into his kitchen; and was still not sorry for what he had done but sat himself angrily and sulkily in the chimney corner .,anger
"but the sparrow sat on the outside of the window and cried "" carter ! thy cruelty shall cost thee thy life !",anger
with that he jumped up in a rage seized his hatchet and threw it at the sparrow; but it missed her and only broke the window .,anger
"the sparrow now hopped in perched upon the windowseat and cried "" carter ! it shall cost thee thy life !",anger
then he became mad and blind with rage and struck the window seat with such force that he cleft it in two : and as the sparrow flew from place to place the carter and his wife were so furious that they broke all their furniture glasses chairs benches the table and at last the walls without touching the bird at all .,anger
"in the end however they caught her : and the wife said "" shall i kill her at once ?",anger
"no "" cried he "" that is letting her off too easily : she shall die a much more cruel death; i will eat her .",anger
"but the sparrow began to flutter about and stretch out her neck and cried "" carter ! it shall cost thee thy life yet !",anger
"with that he could wait no longer : so he gave his wife the hatchet and cried "" wife strike at the bird and kill her in my hand .",anger
and the wife struck; but she missed her aim and hit her husband on the head so that he fell down dead and the sparrow flew quietly home to her nest .,surprise
there was once a shoemaker who worked very hard and was very honest : but still he could not earn enough to live upon; and at last all he had in the world was gone save just leather enough to make one pair of shoes .,sadness
his conscience was clear and his heart light amidst all his troubles; so he went peaceably to bed left all his cares to heaven and soon fell asleep .,joy
in the morning after he had said his prayers he sat himself down to his work; when to his great wonder there stood the shoes all ready made upon the table .,surprise
the good man knew not what to say or think at such an odd thing happening .,surprise
he looked at the workmanship; there was not one false stitch in the whole job; all was so neat and true that it was quite a masterpiece .,joy
the same day a customer came in and the shoes suited him so well that he willingly paid a price higher than usual for them; and the poor shoemaker with the money bought leather enough to make two pairs more .,joy
the wife liked the thought; so they left a light burning and hid themselves in a corner of the room behind a curtain that was hung up there and watched what would happen .,joy
"as soon as it was midnight there came in two little naked dwarfs; and they sat themselves upon the shoemaker "" s bench took up all the work that was cut out and began to ply with their little fingers stitching and rapping and tapping away at such a rate that the shoemaker was all wonder and could not take his eyes off them .",surprise
these little wights have made us rich and we ought to be thankful to them and do them a good turn if we can .,joy
i am quite sorry to see them run about as they do; and indeed it is not very decent for they have nothing upon their backs to keep off the cold .,sadness
the thought pleased the good cobbler very much; and one evening when all the things were ready they laid them on the table instead of the work that they used to cut out and then went and hid themselves to watch what the little elves would do .,joy
about midnight in they came dancing and skipping hopped round the room and then went to sit down to their work as usual; but when they saw the clothes lying for them they laughed and chuckled and seemed mightily delighted .,joy
then they dressed themselves in the twinkling of an eye and danced and capered and sprang about as merry as could be; till at last they danced out at the door and away over the green .,joy
the good couple saw them no more; but everything went well with them from that time forward as long as they lived .,joy
"oh ho ! "" said the man "" you need not make so many words about the matter; i will have nothing to do with a fish that can talk : so swim away sir as soon as you please !",surprise
"did not you ask it for anything ? "" said the wife "" we live very wretchedly here in this nasty dirty pigsty; do go back and tell the fish we want a snug little cottage .",anger
the fisherman did not much like the business : however he went to the seashore; and when he came back there the water looked all yellow and green .,sadness
"ah ! "" said the fisherman "" she says that when i had caught you i ought to have asked you for something before i let you go; she does not like living any longer in the pigsty and wants a snug little cottage .",sadness
"come in come in ! "" said she; "" is not this much better than the filthy pigsty we had ?",joy
"ah ! "" said the fisherman "" how happily we shall live now !",joy
"everything went right for a week or two and then dame ilsabill said "" husband there is not near room enough for us in this cottage; the courtyard and the garden are a great deal too small; i should like to have a large stone castle to live in : go to the fish again and tell him to give us a castle .",anger
"nonsense ! "" said the wife; "" he will do it very willingly i know; go along and try !",anger
"ah ! "" said the man dolefully "" my wife wants to live in a stone castle .",sadness
"see "" said she "" is not this grand ?",joy
"well "" said the man "" now we will live cheerful and happy in this beautiful castle for the rest of our lives .",joy
"husband "" said she "" say no more about it but go and try !",anger
so the man went away quite sorrowful to think that his wife should want to be king .,sadness
"alas ! "" said the poor man "" my wife wants to be king .",sadness
"and when he had looked at her for a long time he said "" ah wife ! what a fine thing it is to be king !",joy
now we shall never have anything more to wish for as long as we live .,joy
i am king it is true; but i begin to be tired of that and i think i should like to be emperor .,anger
"alas wife ! why should you wish to be emperor ? "" said the fisherman .",sadness
"i am king "" said ilsabill "" and you are my slave; so go at once !",anger
"ah ! "" said the man as he gazed upon her "" what a fine thing it is to be emperor !",joy
"well wife "" replied he "" it is a grand thing to be pope; and now you must be easy for you can be nothing greater .",joy
"at this thought she was very angry and wakened her husband and said "" husband go to the fish and tell him i must be lord of the sun and moon .",anger
"no "" said she "" i am very uneasy as long as the sun and moon rise without my leave .",anger
go to the fish at once !,anger
"dear children "" said a poor man to his four sons "" i have nothing to give you; you must go out into the wide world and try your luck .",sadness
"then the eldest said "" here we must part; but this day four years we will come back to this spot and in the meantime each must try what he can do for himself .",sadness
"no "" said the other "" that is not an honest calling and what can one look to earn by it in the end but the gallows ?",anger
"oh ! "" said the man "" you need not fear the gallows; for i will only teach you to steal what will be fair game : i meddle with nothing but what no one else can get or care anything about and where no one can find you out .",surprise
so the young man agreed to follow his trade and he soon showed himself so clever that nothing could escape him that he had once set his mind upon .,joy
"the plan pleased him much and he soon became such a skilful star gazer that when he had served out his time and wanted to leave his master he gave him a glass and said "" with this you can see all that is passing in the sky and on earth and nothing can be hidden from you .",joy
"the third brother met a huntsman who took him with him and taught him so well all that belonged to hunting that he became very clever in the craft of the woods; and when he left his master he gave him a bow and said "" whatever you shoot at with this bow you will be sure to hit .",joy
"oh no ! "" said the young man; "" sitting cross legged from morning to night working backwards and forwards with a needle and goose will never suit me .",anger
"oh ! "" answered the man "" that is not my sort of tailoring; come with me and you will learn quite another kind of craft from that .",surprise
"not knowing what better to do he came into the plan and learnt tailoring from the beginning; and when he left his master he gave him a needle and said "" you can sew anything with this be it as soft as an egg or as hard as steel; and the joint will be so fine that no seam will be seen .",joy
"after the space of four years at the time agreed upon the four brothers met at the four cross roads; and having welcomed each other set off towards their father "" s home where they told him all that had happened to them and how each had learned some craft .",joy
"well done sons ! "" said the old man; "" you have made good use of your time and learnt something worth the knowing; but i am sure i do not know which ought to have the prize .",surprise
oh that a time might soon come for you to turn your skill to some account !,joy
"not long after this there was a great bustle in the country; for the king "" s daughter had been carried off by a mighty dragon and the king mourned over his loss day and night and made it known that whoever brought her back to him should have her for a wife .",surprise
"then the four brothers said to each other "" here is a chance for us; let us try what we can do .",joy
"i will soon find out where she is however "" said the star gazer as he looked through his glass; and he soon cried out "" i see her afar off sitting upon a rock in the sea and i can spy the dragon close by guarding her .",surprise
"i dare not shoot at him "" said the huntsman "" for i should kill the beautiful young lady also .",sadness
"then i will try my skill "" said the thief and went and stole her away from under the dragon so quietly and gently that the beast did not know it but went on snoring .",joy
then away they hastened with her full of joy in their boat towards the ship; but soon came the dragon roaring behind them through the air; for he awoke and missed the princess .,surprise
but when he got over the boat and wanted to pounce upon them and carry off the princess the huntsman took up his bow and shot him straight through the heart so that he fell down dead .,joy
so the tailor took his needle and with a few large stitches put some of the planks together; and he sat down upon these and sailed about and gathered up all pieces of the boat; and then tacked them together so quickly that the boat was soon ready and they then reached the ship and got home safe .,joy
"when they had brought home the princess to her father there was great rejoicing; and he said to the four brothers "" one of you shall marry her but you must settle amongst yourselves which it is to be .",joy
"then there arose a quarrel between them; and the star gazer said "" if i had not found the princess out all your skill would have been of no use; therefore she ought to be mine .",anger
"your seeing her would have been of no use "" said the thief "" if i had not taken her away from the dragon; therefore she ought to be mine .",anger
"no she is mine "" said the huntsman; "" for if i had not killed the dragon he would after all have torn you and the princess into pieces .",anger
"and if i had not sewn the boat together again "" said the tailor "" you would all have been drowned therefore she is mine .",anger
"then the king put in a word and said "" each of you is right; and as all cannot have the young lady the best way is for neither of you to have her : for the truth is there is somebody she likes a great deal better .",surprise
but to make up for your loss i will give each of you as a reward for his skill half a kingdom .,joy
so the brothers agreed that this plan would be much better than either quarrelling or marrying a lady who had no mind to have them .,joy
and the king then gave to each half a kingdom as he had said; and they lived very happily the rest of their days and took good care of their father; and somebody took better care of the young lady than to let either the dragon or one of the craftsmen have her again .,joy
"it happened that the cat met the fox in a forest and as she thought to herself : "" he is clever and full of experience and much esteemed in the world "" she spoke to him in a friendly way .",joy
good day dear mr fox how are you ?,joy
the fox full of all kinds of arrogance looked at the cat from head to foot and for a long time did not know whether he would give any answer or not .,anger
"at last he said : "" oh you wretched beard cleaner you piebald fool you hungry mouse hunter what can you be thinking of ?",anger
have you the cheek to ask how i am getting on ?,anger
what have you learnt ?,anger
how many arts do you understand ?,anger
"i understand but one "" replied the cat modestly .",sadness
"what art is that ? "" asked the fox .",anger
"is that all ? "" said the fox .",anger
"ah mr fox "" cried the cat .",sadness
you with your hundred arts are left in the lurch !,anger
had you been able to climb like me you would not have lost your life .,sadness
"a farmer had a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant to him : but he was now grown too old to work; so the farmer would give him nothing more to eat and said "" i want you no longer so take yourself off out of my stable; i shall not take you back again until you are stronger than a lion .",anger
then he opened the door and turned him adrift .,anger
the poor horse was very melancholy and wandered up and down in the wood seeking some little shelter from the cold wind and rain .,sadness
"ah ! "" replied the horse "" justice and avarice never dwell in one house; my master has forgotten all that i have done for him so many years and because i can no longer work he has turned me adrift and says unless i become stronger than a lion he will not take me back again; what chance can i have of that ? he knows i have none or he would not talk so .",sadness
"however the fox bid him be of good cheer and said "" i will help you; lie down there stretch yourself out quite stiff and pretend to be dead .",joy
"the lion was greatly pleased and set off immediately; and when they came to the horse the fox said "" you will not be able to eat him comfortably here; i "" ll tell you what i will tie you fast to his tail and then you can draw him to your den and eat him at your leisure .",joy
this advice pleased the lion so he laid himself down quietly for the fox to make him fast to the horse .,joy
"the beast began to roar and bellow till all the birds of the wood flew away for fright; but the horse let him sing on and made his way quietly over the fields to his master "" s house .",anger
"here he is master "" said he "" i have got the better of him "" : and when the farmer saw his old servant his heart relented and he said .",joy
thou shalt stay in thy stable and be well taken care of .,joy
and so the poor old horse had plenty to eat and lived till he died .,joy
now she had a golden ball in her hand which was her favourite plaything; and she was always tossing it up into the air and catching it again as it fell .,joy
"then she began to bewail her loss and said "" alas ! if i could only get my ball again i would give all my fine clothes and jewels and everything that i have in the world .",sadness
"whilst she was speaking a frog put its head out of the water and said "" princess why do you weep so bitterly ?",sadness
"alas ! "" said she "" what can you do for me you nasty frog ?",sadness
my golden ball has fallen into the spring .,sadness
"the frog said "" i want not your pearls and jewels and fine clothes; but if you will love me and let me live with you and eat from off your golden plate and sleep upon your bed i will bring you your ball again .",joy
"what nonsense "" thought the princess "" this silly frog is talking !",anger
he can never even get out of the spring to visit me though he may be able to get my ball for me and therefore i will tell him he shall have what he asks .,joy
"so she said to the frog "" well if you will bring me my ball i will do all you ask .",joy
as soon as the young princess saw her ball she ran to pick it up; and she was so overjoyed to have it in her hand again that she never thought of the frog but ran home with it as fast as she could .,joy
"the frog called after her "" stay princess and take me with you as you said "" but she did not stop to hear a word .",sadness
open the door my princess dear open the door to thy true love here !,joy
then the princess ran to the door and opened it and there she saw the frog whom she had quite forgotten .,surprise
at this sight she was sadly frightened and shutting the door as fast as she could came back to her seat .,surprise
the king her father seeing that something had frightened her asked her what was the matter .,surprise
"there is a nasty frog "" said she "" at the door that lifted my ball for me out of the spring this morning : i told him that he should live with me here thinking that he could never get out of the spring; but there he is at the door and he wants to come in .",anger
open the door my princess dear open the door to thy true love here !,anger
and mind the words that thou and i said by the fountain cool in the greenwood shade .,anger
"then the king said to the young princess "" as you have given your word you must keep it; so go and let him in .",anger
she did so and the frog hopped into the room and then straight on tap tap plash plash from the bottom of the room to the top till he came up close to the table where the princess sat .,joy
"pray lift me upon chair "" said he to the princess "" and let me sit next to you .",joy
and the princess though very unwilling took him up in her hand and put him upon the pillow of her own bed where he slept all night long .,anger
"now then "" thought the princess "" at last he is gone and i shall be troubled with him no more .",joy
open the door my princess dear open the door to thy true love here !,anger
and mind the words that thou and i said by the fountain cool in the greenwood shade .,anger
but when the princess awoke on the following morning she was astonished to see instead of the frog a handsome prince gazing on her with the most beautiful eyes she had ever seen and standing at the head of her bed .,surprise
he told her that he had been enchanted by a spiteful fairy who had changed him into a frog; and that he had been fated so to abide till some princess should take him out of the spring and let him eat from her plate and sleep upon her bed for three nights .,joy
"you "" said the prince "" have broken his cruel charm and now i have nothing to wish for but that you should go with me into my father "" s kingdom where i will marry you and love you as long as you live .",joy
"the young princess you may be sure was not long in saying "" yes "" to all this; and as they spoke a gay coach drove up with eight beautiful horses decked with plumes of feathers and a golden harness; and behind the coach rode the prince "" s servant faithful heinrich who had bewailed the misfortunes of his dear master during his enchantment so long and so bitterly that his heart had well nigh burst .",joy
"they then took leave of the king and got into the coach with eight horses and all set out full of joy and merriment for the prince "" s kingdom which they reached safely; and there they lived happily a great many years .",joy
the king became very angry at this and ordered the gardener to keep watch all night under the tree .,anger
but the arrow did the bird no harm; only it dropped a golden feather from its tail and then flew away .,surprise
"everyone agreed that it was worth more than all the wealth of the kingdom : but the king said "" one feather is of no use to me i must have the whole bird .",anger
"but the son thought to himself "" what can such a beast as this know about the matter ?",anger
"i should be very silly "" said he "" if i went to that shabby house and left this charming place "" ; so he went into the smart house and ate and drank at his ease and forgot the bird and his country too .",joy
he met the fox who gave him the good advice : but when he came to the two inns his eldest brother was standing at the window where the merrymaking was and called to him to come in; and he could not withstand the temptation but went in and forgot the golden bird and his country in the same manner .,joy
"but he was thankful to the fox and did not attempt his life as his brothers had done; so the fox said "" sit upon my tail and you will travel faster .",joy
"when they came to the village the son followed the fox "" s counsel and without looking about him went to the shabby inn and rested there all night at his ease .",joy
before the castle gate all was as the fox had said : so the son went in and found the chamber where the golden bird hung in a wooden cage and below stood the golden cage and the three golden apples that had been lost were lying close by it .,surprise
but the bird set up such a loud scream that all the soldiers awoke and they took him prisoner and carried him before the king .,surprise
"so he set out once more on his journey sighing and in great despair when on a sudden his friend the fox met him and said "" you see now what has happened on account of your not listening to my counsel .",sadness
but when the son looked at the horse he thought it a great pity to put the leathern saddle upon it .,sadness
as he took up the golden saddle the groom awoke and cried out so loud that all the guards ran in and took him prisoner and in the morning he was again brought before the court to be judged and was sentenced to die .,surprise
"then he went his way very sorrowful; but the old fox came and said "" why did not you listen to me ?",sadness
"as they came to the castle all was as the fox had said and at twelve o "" clock the young man met the princes going to the bath and gave her the kiss and she agreed to run away with him but begged with many tears that he would let her take leave of her father .",sadness
"at first he refused but she wept still more and more and fell at his feet till at last he consented; but the moment she came to her father "" s house the guards awoke and he was taken prisoner again .",surprise
now this hill was so big that the whole world could not take it away : and when he had worked for seven days and had done very little the fox came and said .,sadness
and in the morning he awoke and the hill was gone; so he went merrily to the king and told him that now that it was removed he must give him the princess .,surprise
"then the king was obliged to keep his word and away went the young man and the princess; and the fox came and said to him "" we will have all three the princess the horse and the bird .",joy
"ah ! "" said the young man "" that would be a great thing but how can you contrive it ?",joy
"if you will only listen "" said the fox "" it can be done .",anger
this too happened as the fox said; they carried off the bird the princess mounted again and they rode on to a great wood .,joy
"then the fox came and said "" pray kill me and cut off my head and my feet .",surprise
"well "" thought the young man "" it is no hard matter to keep that advice .",joy
"and there he heard a great noise and uproar; and when he asked what was the matter the people said "" two men are going to be hanged .",anger
"as he came nearer he saw that the two men were his brothers who had turned robbers; so he said "" cannot they in any way be saved ?",sadness
"but the people said "" no "" unless he would bestow all his money upon the rascals and buy their liberty .",sadness
then he did not stay to think about the matter but paid what was asked and his brothers were given up and went on with him towards their home .,joy
"so he said "" yes "" and forgot the fox "" s counsel and sat down on the side of the river; and while he suspected nothing they came behind and threw him down the bank and took the princess the horse and the bird and went home to the king their master and said .",surprise
all this have we won by our labour .,joy
then there was great rejoicing made; but the horse would not eat the bird would not sing and the princess wept .,sadness
"then the old fox came once more and scolded him for not following his advice; otherwise no evil would have befallen him : "" yet "" said he "" i cannot leave you here so lay hold of my tail and hold fast .",anger
"then he pulled him out of the river and said to him as he got upon the bank "" your brothers have set watch to kill you if they find you in the kingdom .",surprise
"so he dressed himself as a poor man and came secretly to the king "" s court and was scarcely within the doors when the horse began to eat and the bird to sing and princess left off weeping .",joy
"then he went to the king and told him all his brothers "" roguery; and they were seized and punished and he had the princess given to him again; and after the king "" s death he was heir to his kingdom .",joy
a long while after he went to walk one day in the wood and the old fox met him and besought him with tears in his eyes to kill him and cut off his head and feet .,sadness
and at last he did so and in a moment the fox was changed into a man and turned out to be the brother of the princess who had been lost a great many many years .,joy
there was a man who had three sons the youngest of whom was called dummling[*] and was despised mocked and sneered at on every occasion .,sadness
"when he entered the forest he met a little grey haired old man who bade him good day and said : "" do give me a piece of cake out of your pocket and let me have a draught of your wine; i am so hungry and thirsty .",sadness
"but the clever son answered : "" if i give you my cake and wine i shall have none for myself; be off with you "" and he left the little man standing and went on .",anger
"and this was the little grey man "" s doing .",surprise
the little old grey man met him likewise and asked him for a piece of cake and a drink of wine .,sadness
"but the second son too said sensibly enough : "" what i give you will be taken away from myself; be off ! "" and he left the little man standing and went on .",anger
"then dummling said : "" father do let me go and cut wood .",sadness
"but dummling begged so long that at last he said : "" just go then you will get wiser by hurting yourself .",sadness
"when he came to the forest the little old grey man met him likewise and greeting him said : "" give me a piece of your cake and a drink out of your bottle; i am so hungry and thirsty .",sadness
"dummling answered : "" i have only cinder cake and sour beer; if that pleases you we will sit down and eat .",sadness
so they sat down and when dummling pulled out his cinder cake it was a fine sweet cake and the sour beer had become good wine .,surprise
"so they ate and drank and after that the little man said : "" since you have a good heart and are willing to divide what you have i will give you good luck .",joy
dummling went and cut down the tree and when it fell there was a goose sitting in the roots with feathers of pure gold .,surprise
he lifted her up and taking her with him went to an inn where he thought he would stay the night .,joy
"the eldest thought : "" i shall soon find an opportunity of pulling out a feather "" and as soon as dummling had gone out she seized the goose by the wing but her finger and hand remained sticking fast to it .",surprise
the second came soon afterwards thinking only of how she might get a feather for herself but she had scarcely touched her sister than she was held fast .,surprise
"at last the third also came with the like intent and the others screamed out : "" keep away; for goodness "" sake keep away !",anger
but she did not understand why she was to keep away .,sadness
"the others are there "" she thought "" i may as well be there too "" and ran to them; but as soon as she had touched her sister she remained sticking fast to her .",anger
so they had to spend the night with the goose .,anger
"in the middle of the fields the parson met them and when he saw the procession he said : "" for shame you good for nothing girls why are you running across the fields after this young man ?",anger
is that seemly ?,anger
at the same time he seized the youngest by the hand in order to pull her away but as soon as he touched her he likewise stuck fast and was himself obliged to run behind .,surprise
before long the sexton came by and saw his master the parson running behind three girls .,surprise
"he was astonished at this and called out : "" hi ! your reverence whither away so quickly ?",surprise
"do not forget that we have a christening today ! "" and running after him he took him by the sleeve but was also held fast to it .",surprise
but they had scarcely touched the sexton when they were held fast and now there were seven of them running behind dummling and the goose .,surprise
"when dummling heard this he went with his goose and all her train before the king "" s daughter and as soon as she saw the seven people running on and on one behind the other she began to laugh quite loudly and as if she would never stop .",joy
dummling thought of the little grey man who could certainly help him; so he went into the forest and in the same place where he had felled the tree he saw a man sitting who had a very sorrowful face .,surprise
"dummling asked him what he was taking to heart so sorely and he answered : "" i have such a great thirst and cannot quench it; cold water i cannot stand a barrel of wine i have just emptied but that to me is like a drop on a hot stone !",sadness
"there i can help you "" said dummling "" just come with me and you shall be satisfied .",joy
"he led him into the king "" s cellar and the man bent over the huge barrels and drank and drank till his loins hurt and before the day was out he had emptied all the barrels .",joy
then dummling asked once more for his bride but the king was vexed that such an ugly fellow whom everyone called dummling should take away his daughter and he made a new condition; he must first find a man who could eat a whole mountain of bread .,anger
"dummling did not think long but went straight into the forest where in the same place there sat a man who was tying up his body with a strap and making an awful face and saying : "" i have eaten a whole ovenful of rolls but what good is that when one has such a hunger as i ?",sadness
my stomach remains empty and i must tie myself up if i am not to die of hunger .,sadness
"at this dummling was glad and said : "" get up and come with me; you shall eat yourself full .",joy
the man from the forest stood before it began to eat and by the end of one day the whole mountain had vanished .,joy
then dummling for the third time asked for his bride; but the king again sought a way out and ordered a ship which could sail on land and on water .,anger
"as soon as you come sailing back in it "" said he "" you shall have my daughter for wife .",anger
dummling went straight into the forest and there sat the little grey man to whom he had given his cake .,surprise
"when he heard what dummling wanted he said : "" since you have given me to eat and to drink i will give you the ship; and i do all this because you once were kind to me .",joy
then he gave him the ship which could sail on land and water and when the king saw that he could no longer prevent him from having his daughter .,anger
"the wedding was celebrated and after the king "" s death dummling inherited his kingdom and lived for a long time contentedly with his wife .",joy
they loved each other dearly but sorrowed much that they had no children .,sadness
so greatly did they desire to have one that the wife prayed for it day and night but still they remained childless .,sadness
"ah "" sighed the woman heavily "" if i had but a child as red as blood and as white as snow "" and as she spoke the words her heart grew light within her and it seemed to her that her wish was granted and she returned to the house feeling glad and comforted .",joy
once again the wife stood under the juniper tree and it was so full of sweet scent that her heart leaped for joy and she was so overcome with her happiness that she fell on her knees .,joy
presently the fruit became round and firm and she was glad and at peace; but when they were fully ripe she picked the berries and ate eagerly of them and then she grew sad and ill .,sadness
a little while later she called her husband and said to him weeping .,sadness
if i die bury me under the juniper tree .,sadness
then she felt comforted and happy again and before another month had passed she had a little child and when she saw that it was as white as snow and as red as blood her joy was so great that she died .,joy
her husband buried her under the juniper tree and wept bitterly for her .,sadness
by degrees however his sorrow grew less and although at times he still grieved over his loss he was able to go about as usual and later on he married again .,sadness
he now had a little daughter born to him; the child of his first wife was a boy who was as red as blood and as white as snow .,joy
the mother loved her daughter very much and when she looked at her and then looked at the boy it pierced her heart to think that he would always stand in the way of her own child and she was continually thinking how she could get the whole of the property for her .,anger
this evil thought took possession of her more and more and made her behave very unkindly to the boy .,anger
"mother "" said the little daughter again "" may not brother have one too ?",surprise
"the mother was angry at this but she answered "" yes when he comes out of school .",anger
"just then she looked out of the window and saw him coming and it seemed as if an evil spirit entered into her for she snatched the apple out of her little daughter "" s hand and said "" you shall not have one before your brother .",anger
she threw the apple into the chest and shut it to .,anger
"the little boy now came in and the evil spirit in the wife made her say kindly to him "" my son will you have an apple ? "" but she gave him a wicked look .",anger
the thought came to her that she would kill him .,anger
"and as he bent over to do so the evil spirit urged her and crash ! down went the lid and off went the little boy "" s head .",surprise
"so little marleen went and said "" brother give me that apple "" but he did not say a word; then she gave him a box on the ear and his head rolled off .",surprise
"oh ! "" she said "" i have knocked off brother "" s head "" and then she wept and wept and nothing would stop her .",sadness
"what have you done ! "" said her mother "" but no one must know about it so you must keep silence; what is done can "" t be undone; we will make him into puddings .",anger
but marleen stood looking on and wept and wept and her tears fell into the pot so that there was no need of salt .,sadness
"presently the father came home and sat down to his dinner; he asked "" where is my son ?",surprise
the mother said nothing but gave him a large dish of black pudding and marleen still wept without ceasing .,sadness
what has he gone there for and he never even said goodbye to me !,anger
"i feel very unhappy about it "" said the husband "" in case it should not be all right and he ought to have said goodbye to me .",sadness
"with this he went on with his dinner and said "" little marleen why do you weep ?",surprise
little marleen went upstairs and took her best silk handkerchief out of her bottom drawer and in it she wrapped all the bones from under the table and carried them outside and all the time she did nothing but weep .,sadness
then she laid them in the green grass under the junipertree and she had no sooner done so then all her sadness seemed to leave her and she wept no more .,joy
and now the juniper tree began to move and the branches waved backwards and forwards first away from one another and then together again as it might be someone clapping their hands for joy .,surprise
after this a mist came round the tree and in the midst of it there was a burning as of fire and out of the fire there flew a beautiful bird that rose high into the air singing magnificently and when it could no more be seen the juniper tree stood there as before and the silk handkerchief and the bones were gone .,surprise
little marleen now felt as lighthearted and happy as if her brother were still alive and she went back to the house and sat down cheerfully to the table and ate .,joy
my mother killed her little son; my father grieved when i was gone; my sister loved me best of all; she laid her kerchief over me and took my bones that they might lie underneath the juniper tree kywitt kywitt what a beautiful bird am i !,joy
he thought it so beautiful that he got up and ran out and as he crossed the threshold he lost one of his slippers .,joy
but he ran on into the middle of the street with a slipper on one foot and a sock on the other; he still had on his apron and still held the gold chain and the pincers in his hands and so he stood gazing up at the bird while the sun came shining brightly down on the street .,joy
"bird "" he said "" how beautifully you sing !",joy
only sing me that again .,sadness
the bird flew down and took the gold chain in his right claw and then he alighted again in front of the goldsmith and sang :,joy
my mother killed her little son; my father grieved when i was gone; my sister loved me best of all; she laid her kerchief over me and took my bones that they might lie underneath the juniper tree kywitt kywitt what a beautiful bird am i !,joy
my mother killed her little son; my father grieved when i was gone; my sister loved me best of all; she laid her kerchief over me and took my bones that they might lie underneath the juniper tree kywitt kywitt what a beautiful bird am i !,joy
the shoemaker heard him and he jumped up and ran out in his shirtsleeves and stood looking up at the bird on the roof with his hand over his eyes to keep himself from being blinded by the sun .,surprise
"bird "" he said "" how beautifully you sing !",joy
"then he called through the door to his wife : "" wife come out; here is a bird come and look at it and hear how beautifully it sings .",joy
then he called his daughter and the children then the apprentices girls and boys and they all ran up the street to look at the bird and saw how splendid it was with its red and green feathers and its neck like burnished gold and eyes like two bright stars in its head .,joy
my mother killed her little son; my father grieved when i was gone; my sister loved me best of all; she laid her kerchief over me and took my bones that they might lie underneath the juniper tree kywitt kywitt what a beautiful bird am i !,joy
two more men left off and listened,surprise
then four more left off,surprise
kywitt kywitt what a beautiful bird am i !,joy
then he looked up and the last one had left off work .,surprise
"bird "" he said "" what a beautiful song that is you sing !",joy
let me hear it too; sing it again .,joy
my mother killed her little son; my father grieved when i was gone; my sister loved me best of all; she laid her kerchief over me and took my bones that they might lie underneath the juniper tree kywitt kywitt what a beautiful bird am i !,joy
"and when he had finished his song he spread his wings and with the chain in his right claw the shoes in his left and the millstone round his neck he flew right away to his father "" s house .",joy
"how lighthearted i feel "" said the father "" so pleased and cheerful .",joy
but little marleen sat and wept and wept .,sadness
"i do feel so happy "" said the father "" and how beautifully the sun shines; i feel just as if i were going to see an old friend again .",joy
"look mother "" said the man "" at the beautiful bird that is singing so magnificently; and how warm and bright the sun is and what a delicious scent of spice in the air !",joy
my sister loved me best of all;,joy
then little marleen laid her head down on her knees and sobbed .,sadness
"i must go outside and see the bird nearer "" said the man .",joy
she laid her kerchief over me and took my bones that they might lie underneath the juniper tree kywitt kywitt what a beautiful bird am i !,joy
"he went inside and said "" see what a splendid bird that is; he has given me this beautiful gold chain and looks so beautiful himself .",joy
my sister loved me best of all;,joy
underneath the juniper tree kywitt kywitt what a beautiful bird am i !,joy
and she now felt quite happy and lighthearted; she put on the shoes and danced and jumped about in them .,joy
"i was so miserable "" she said "" when i came out but that has all passed away; that is indeed a splendid bird and he has given me a pair of red shoes .",joy
but as she crossed the threshold crash ! the bird threw the millstone down on her head and she was crushed to death .,surprise
the father and little marleen heard the sound and ran out but they only saw mist and flame and fire rising from the spot and when these had passed there stood the little brother and he took the father and little marleen by the hand; then they all three rejoiced and went inside together and sat down to their dinners and ate .,joy
one day as he was roaming along in a brown study thinking with no great comfort on what he had been and what he now was and was like to be all on a sudden there stood before him a little rough looking black dwarf .,surprise
"prithee friend why so sorrowful ? "" said he to the merchant; "" what is it you take so deeply to heart ?",sadness
but as he drew near home his little boy was so glad to see him that he crept behind him and laid fast hold of his legs and looked up in his face and laughed .,joy
at the sight of this he was overjoyed and forgetting all about his son went into trade again and became a richer merchant than before .,joy
meantime little heinel grew up and as the end of the twelve years drew near the merchant began to call to mind his bond and became very sad and thoughtful; so that care and sorrow were written upon his face .,sadness
the old man grinned and showed his teeth as if he should have been very glad to get into the circle if he could .,joy
then he took leave of his father and set himself in the boat but before it got far off a wave struck it and it fell with one side low in the water so the merchant thought that poor heinel was lost and went home very sorrowful while the dwarf went his way thinking that at any rate he had had his revenge .,sadness
the young man sat safe within till at length it ran ashore upon an unknown land .,joy
"now the white snake was an enchanted princess; and she was very glad to see him and said "" are you at last come to set me free ?",joy
and all came to pass as she had said; heinel bore all and spoke not a word; and the third night the princess came and fell on his neck and kissed him .,joy
joy and gladness burst forth throughout the castle the wedding was celebrated and he was crowned king of the golden mountain .,joy
they lived together very happily and the queen had a son .,joy
and thus eight years had passed over their heads when the king thought of his father; and he began to long to see him once again .,sadness
"when he came to his father "" s house he said he was his son; but the merchant would not believe him and said he had had but one son his poor heinel who he knew was long since dead : and as he was only dressed like a poor shepherd he would not even give him anything to eat .",sadness
at this the son was vexed; and forgetting his word turned his ring and wished for his queen and son .,anger
in an instant they stood before him; but the queen wept and said he had broken his word and bad luck would follow .,sadness
he did all he could to soothe her and she at last seemed to be appeased; but she was not so in truth and was only thinking how she should punish him .,anger
"alas ! "" said she to herself "" was i not once set free ?",sadness
"false and fickle one ! "" said he .",anger
but the princes peers and great men mocked at him .,anger
he had not even so much as a cow and still less money to buy one and yet he and his wife did so wish to have one .,sadness
"the little calf always remained standing like one which was eating and the cow herd said : "" it will soon run by itself just look how it eats already !",joy
"at night when he was going to drive the herd home again he said to the calf : "" if you can stand there and eat your fill you can also go on your four legs; i don "" t care to drag you home again in my arms .",anger
it would not stop and come with us .,anger
"the peasant however said : "" don "" t tell me that "" and led the cow herd before the mayor who for his carelessness condemned him to give the peasant a cow for the calf which had run away .",anger
and now the little peasant and his wife had the cow for which they had so long wished and they were heartily glad but they had no food for it and could give it nothing to eat so it soon had to be killed .,sadness
they salted the flesh and the peasant went into the town and wanted to sell the skin there so that he might buy a new calf with the proceeds .,sadness
on the way he passed by a mill and there sat a raven with broken wings and out of pity he took him and wrapped him in the skin .,sadness
"in the meantime came the parson; the miller "" s wife received him well and said : "" my husband is out so we will have a feast .",joy
the peasant listened and when he heard them talk about feasting he was vexed that he had been forced to make shift with a slice of bread and cheese .,anger
just as they were about to sit down and eat there was a knocking outside .,surprise
"the woman said : "" oh heavens !",surprise
"it is my husband ! "" she quickly hid the roast meat inside the tiled stove the wine under the pillow the salad on the bed the cakes under it and the parson in the closet on the porch .",surprise
"the miller saw the peasant lying on the straw and asked "" what is that fellow doing there ?",surprise
"ah "" said the wife "" the poor knave came in the storm and rain and begged for shelter so i gave him a bit of bread and cheese and showed him where the straw was .",sadness
"the woman said : "" but i have nothing but bread and cheese .",anger
"i am contented with anything "" replied the husband "" so far as i am concerned bread and cheese will do "" and looked at the peasant and said : "" come and eat some more with me .",joy
the peasant did not require to be invited twice but got up and ate .,joy
"after this the miller saw the skin in which the raven was lying on the ground and asked : "" what have you there ?",surprise
"can he foretell anything to me ? "" said the miller .",surprise
"why not ? "" answered the peasant : "" but he only says four things and the fifth he keeps to himself .",surprise
"the miller was curious and said : "" let him foretell something for once .",surprise
"the miller said : "" what did he say ?",surprise
"bless me ! "" cried the miller and went there and found the wine .",surprise
"now go on "" said he .",surprise
"upon my word ! "" cried the miller and went thither and found the roast meat .",surprise
"that would be a fine thing ! "" cried the miller and went there and found the salad .",surprise
"that would be a fine thing ! "" cried the miller and looked there and found the cakes .",surprise
the peasant however made off next morning by daybreak with the three hundred talers .,joy
"at home the small peasant gradually launched out; he built a beautiful house and the peasants said : "" the small peasant has certainly been to the place where golden snow falls and people carry the gold home in shovels .",joy
when the peasants heard that they too wished to enjoy this great profit and ran home killed all their cows and stripped off their skins in order to sell them in the town to the greatest advantage .,surprise
"the mayor however said : "" but my servant must go first .",anger
"when she came to the merchant in the town he did not give her more than two talers for a skin and when the others came he did not give them so much and said : "" what can i do with all these skins ?",anger
then the peasants were vexed that the small peasant should have thus outwitted them wanted to take vengeance on him and accused him of this treachery before the major .,anger
"the others were all obliged to retire to a distance and when the peasant looked at the priest he recognized the man who had been with the miller "" s wife .",surprise
"the shepherd hearing that came up to him and asked : "" what are you about ?",surprise
what is it that you will not do ?,surprise
"the shepherd said : "" if nothing more than that is needful in order to be mayor i would get into the barrel at once .",surprise
"the shepherd was willing and got in and the peasant shut the top down on him; then he took the shepherd "" s flock for himself and drove it away .",joy
"they believed no otherwise than that it was the peasant who was saying this and answered : "" that is what we intend but first you shall look about you a little down below there "" and they rolled the barrel down into the water .",joy
after that the peasants went home and as they were entering the village the small peasant also came quietly in driving a flock of sheep and looking quite contented .,joy
"then the peasants were astonished and said : "" peasant from whence do you come ?",surprise
have you come out of the water ?,surprise
"yes truly "" replied the peasant "" i sank deep deep down until at last i got to the bottom; i pushed the bottom out of the barrel and crept out and there were pretty meadows on which a number of lambs were feeding and from thence i brought this flock away with me .",joy
"said the peasants : "" are there any more there ?",surprise
"oh yes "" said he "" more than i could want .",joy
"then the peasants made up their minds that they too would fetch some sheep for themselves a flock apiece but the mayor said : "" i come first .",joy
"so they went to the water together and just then there were some of the small fleecy clouds in the blue sky which are called little lambs and they were reflected in the water whereupon the peasants cried : "" we already see the sheep down below !",surprise
"the mayor pressed forward and said : "" i will go down first and look about me and if things promise well i "" ll call you .",surprise
so he jumped in; splash ! went the water; it sounded as if he were calling them and the whole crowd plunged in after him as one man .,joy
then the entire village was dead and the small peasant as sole heir became a rich man .,joy
a farmer had a faithful and diligent servant who had worked hard for him three years without having been paid any wages .,anger
"at last it came into the man "" s head that he would not go on thus without pay any longer; so he went to his master and said "" i have worked hard for you a long time i will trust to you to give me what i deserve to have for my trouble .",anger
"the poor fellow thought it was a great deal of money to have and said to himself "" why should i work hard and live here on bad fare any longer ?",joy
i can now travel into the wide world and make myself merry .,joy
with that he put his money into his purse and set out roaming over hill and valley .,joy
as he jogged along over the fields singing and dancing a little dwarf met him and asked him what made him so merry .,joy
"why what should make me down hearted ? "" said he; "" i am sound in health and rich in purse what should i care for ?",joy
"i have saved up my three years "" earnings and have it all safe in my pocket .",joy
"i wish you would give them to me "" said the other; "" i am very poor .",sadness
"then the man pitied him and gave him all he had; and the little dwarf said in return "" as you have such a kind honest heart i will grant you three wishes one for every penny; so choose whatever you like .",joy
"then the countryman rejoiced at his good luck and said "" i like many things better than money : first i will have a bow that will bring down everything i shoot at; secondly a fiddle that will set everyone dancing that hears me play upon it; and thirdly i should like that everyone should grant what i ask .",joy
the dwarf said he should have his three wishes; so he gave him the bow and fiddle and went his way .,joy
our honest friend journeyed on his way too; and if he was merry before he was now ten times more so .,joy
"oh what a pretty bird ! "" said the miser; "" i would give a great deal of money to have such a one .",joy
the miser crept into the bush to find it; but directly he had got into the middle his companion took up his fiddle and played away and the miser began to dance and spring about capering higher and higher in the air .,anger
"thou hast shaved many a poor soul close enough "" said the other; "" thou art only meeting thy reward "" : so he played up another tune .",anger
"when the countryman saw so much money he said "" i will agree to your proposal .",surprise
so he took the purse put up his fiddle and travelled on very pleased with his bargain .,joy
meanwhile the miser crept out of the bush half naked and in a piteous plight and began to ponder how he should take his revenge and serve his late companion some trick .,anger
at last he went to the judge and complained that a rascal had robbed him of his money and beaten him into the bargain; and that the fellow who did it carried a bow at his back and a fiddle hung round his neck .,anger
then the judge sent out his officers to bring up the accused wherever they should find him; and he was soon caught and brought up to be tried .,surprise
the miser began to tell his tale and said he had been robbed of his money .,anger
"no you gave it me for playing a tune to you . "" said the countryman; but the judge told him that was not likely and cut the matter short by ordering him off to the gallows .",anger
"anything but thy life "" replied the other .",anger
"the miser cried out "" oh no ! no ! for heaven "" s sake don "" t listen to him ! don "" t listen to him !",anger
"but the judge said "" it is only this once he will soon have done .",anger
"the fact was he could not refuse the request on account of the dwarf "" s third gift .",anger
but the countryman seized his fiddle and struck up a tune and at the first note judge clerks and jailer were in motion; all began capering and no one could hold the miser .,anger
at the second note the hangman let his prisoner go and danced also and by the time he had played the first bar of the tune all were dancing together judge court and miser and all the people who had followed to look on .,anger
"then he called to the miser and said "" tell us now you vagabond where you got that gold or i shall play on for your amusement only "" "" i stole it "" said the miser in the presence of all the people; "" i acknowledge that i stole it and that you earned it fairly .",anger
then the countryman stopped his fiddle and left the miser to take his place at the gallows .,anger
for a long time all went well; they lived in great comfort and prospered so far as to be able to add considerably to their stores .,joy
and so it came to pass that the bird while out one day met a fellow bird to whom he boastfully expatiated on the excellence of his household arrangements .,joy
but the other bird sneered at him for being a poor simpleton who did all the hard work while the other two stayed at home and had a good time of it .,anger
the sausage had only to watch the pot to see that the food was properly cooked and when it was near dinner time he just threw himself into the broth or rolled in and out among the vegetables three or four times and there they were buttered and salted and ready to be served .,joy
influenced by those remarks the bird next morning refused to bring in the wood telling the others that he had been their servant long enough and had been a fool into the bargain and that it was now time to make a change and to try some other way of arranging the work .,anger
beg and pray as the mouse and the sausage might it was of no use; the bird remained master of the situation and the venture had to be made .,anger
they therefore drew lots and it fell to the sausage to bring in the wood to the mouse to cook and to the bird to fetch the water .,sadness
the bird complained to the dog of this bare faced robbery but nothing he said was of any avail for the dog answered that he found false credentials on the sausage and that was the reason his life had been forfeited .,anger
he picked up the wood and flew sadly home and told the mouse all he had seen and heard .,sadness
they were both very unhappy but agreed to make the best of things and to remain with one another .,sadness
presently the bird came in and wanted to serve up the dinner but he could nowhere see the cook .,sadness
there was once a very old man whose eyes had become dim his ears dull of hearing his knees trembled and when he sat at table he could hardly hold the spoon and spilt the broth upon the table cloth or let it run out of his mouth .,sadness
"his son and his son "" s wife were disgusted at this so the old grandfather at last had to sit in the corner behind the stove and they gave him his food in an earthenware bowl and not even enough of it .",anger
and he used to look towards the table with his eyes full of tears .,sadness
once too his trembling hands could not hold the bowl and it fell to the ground and broke .,sadness
the young wife scolded him but he said nothing and only sighed .,anger
then they brought him a wooden bowl for a few half pence out of which he had to eat .,sadness
"i am making a little trough "" answered the child "" for father and mother to eat out of when i am big .",sadness
the man and his wife looked at each other for a while and presently began to cry .,sadness
then they took the old grandfather to the table and henceforth always let him eat with them and likewise said nothing if he did spill a little of anything .,joy
"then an angel from heaven came to her and said : "" be at rest you shall have a son with the power of wishing so that whatsoever in the world he wishes for that shall he have .",joy
then she went to the king and told him the joyful tidings and when the time was come she gave birth to a son and the king was filled with gladness .,joy
then he carried the child away to a secret place where a nurse was obliged to suckle it and he ran to the king and accused the queen of having allowed her child to be taken from her by the wild beasts .,anger
when the king saw the blood on her apron he believed this fell into such a passion that he ordered a high tower to be built in which neither sun nor moon could be seen and had his wife put into it and walled up .,anger
here she was to stay for seven years without meat or drink and die of hunger .,anger
"after a while the cook said to him : "" it is not well for you to be so alone wish for a pretty girl as a companion .",sadness
the two played together and loved each other with all their hearts and the old cook went out hunting like a nobleman .,joy
"so he went out and took the maiden aside and said : "" tonight when the boy is asleep go to his bed and plunge this knife into his heart and bring me his heart and tongue and if you do not do it you shall lose your life .",anger
"thereupon he went away and when he returned next day she had not done it and said : "" why should i shed the blood of an innocent boy who has never harmed anyone ?",anger
"the cook once more said : "" if you do not do it it shall cost you your own life .",anger
"then the wicked wretch came in and said : "" where are the boy "" s heart and tongue ?",anger
"the girl reached the plate to him but the king "" s son threw off the quilt and said : "" you old sinner why did you want to kill me ?",anger
now will i pronounce thy sentence .,anger
you shall become a black poodle and have a gold collar round your neck and shall eat burning coals till the flames burst forth from your throat .,anger
"at length he said to the maiden : "" i will go home to my own country; if you will go with me i will provide for you .",joy
"ah "" she replied "" the way is so long and what shall i do in a strange land where i am unknown ?",sadness
then they were all placed on sixty country carts and driven home to the king and for once he was able to deck his table with game after having had none at all for years .,joy
now the king felt great joy at this and commanded that his entire household should eat with him next day and made a great feast .,joy
"when they were all assembled together he said to the huntsman : "" as you are so clever you shall sit by me .",joy
"whilst he was sitting there he thought of his dearest mother and wished that one of the king "" s principal servants would begin to speak of her and would ask how it was faring with the queen in the tower and if she were alive still or had perished .",sadness
"hardly had he formed the wish than the marshal began and said : "" your majesty we live joyously here but how is the queen living in the tower ?",joy
"but the king replied : "" she let my dear son be torn to pieces by wild beasts; i will not have her named .",anger
"thereupon he took the dog with the golden collar and said : "" that is the wretch ! "" and caused live coals to be brought and these the dog was compelled to devour before the sight of all until flames burst forth from its throat .",anger
when the king saw him he fell into a passion and ordered him to be cast into the deepest dungeon .,anger
"the king replied : "" yes i would like to see her .",joy
"the son said : "" most gracious father i will show her to you in the form of a beautiful flower "" and he thrust his hand into his pocket and brought forth the pink and placed it on the royal table and it was so beautiful that the king had never seen one to equal it .",joy
"but when she was led in she ate nothing and said : "" the gracious and merciful god who has supported me in the tower will soon set me free .",sadness
she lived three days more and then died happily and when she was buried the two white doves which had brought her food to the tower and were angels of heaven followed her body and seated themselves on her grave .,joy
"the aged king ordered the cook to be torn in four pieces but grief consumed the king "" s own heart and he soon died .",sadness
then their brother who was a little insignificant dwarf went out to seek for his brothers : but when he had found them they only laughed at him to think that he who was so young and simple should try to travel through the world when they who were so much wiser had been unable to get on .,anger
the two elder brothers would have pulled it down in order to see how the poor ants in their fright would run about and carry off their eggs .,anger
"but the little dwarf said "" let the poor things enjoy themselves i will not suffer you to trouble them .",anger
"but the dwarf said "" let the poor things enjoy themselves you shall not kill them .",anger
"but the dwarf held them back and said "" let the pretty insects enjoy themselves i cannot let you burn them .",anger
"at last came the little dwarf "" s turn; and he looked in the moss; but it was so hard to find the pearls and the job was so tiresome ! so he sat down upon a stone and cried .",sadness
"and the dwarf married the youngest and the best of the princesses and was king after her father "" s death; but his two brothers married the other two sisters .",joy
one day the child was very troublesome and the mother could not quiet it do what she would .,anger
"she grew impatient and seeing the ravens flying round the castle she opened the window and said : "" i wish you were a raven and would fly away then i should have a little peace .",anger
scarcely were the words out of her mouth when the child in her arms was turned into a raven and flew away from her through the open window .,surprise
the bird took its flight to a dark wood and remained there for a long time and meanwhile the parents could hear nothing of their child .,sadness
"as he drew near the raven said "" i am by birth a king "" s daughter but am now under the spell of some enchantment; you can however set me free .",joy
"what am i to do ? "" he asked .",surprise
"the man promised to do all that she wished but the raven said "" alas !",sadness
i know even now that you will take something from the woman and be unable to save me .,sadness
the man assured her again that he would on no account touch a thing to eat or drink .,joy
"when he came to the house and went inside the old woman met him and said "" poor man ! how tired you are !",surprise
come in and rest and let me give you something to eat and drink .,joy
"no "" answered the man "" i will neither eat not drink .",anger
"but she would not leave him alone and urged him saying "" if you will not eat anything at least you might take a draught of wine; one drink counts for nothing "" and at last he allowed himself to be persuaded and drank .",anger
suddenly a feeling of fatigue came over him and unable to resist it he lay down for a little while fully determined however to keep awake; but in another minute his eyes closed of their own accord and he fell into such a deep sleep that all the noises in the world would not have awakened him .,surprise
"at two o "" clock the raven came driving along drawn by her four white horses; but even before she reached the spot she said to herself sighing "" i know he has fallen asleep .",sadness
when she entered the garden there she found him as she had feared lying on the tan heap fast asleep .,sadness
she got out of her carriage and went to him; she called him and shook him but it was all in vain he still continued sleeping .,anger
at last overcome by her persistent entreaties that he would take something he lifted the glass and drank again .,surprise
"as the raven drove along her four chestnut horses she said sorrowfully to herself "" i know he has fallen asleep .",anger
she went as before to look for him but he slept and it was impossible to awaken him .,sadness
"the following day the old woman said to him "" what is this ?",surprise
you are not eating or drinking anything do you want to kill yourself ?,anger
"she was sadder than ever as she drove along and said mournfully "" i know he has fallen asleep and will not be able to set me free .",sadness
she found him sleeping heavily and all her efforts to awaken him were of no avail .,sadness
"finally she laid a letter near him in which after giving him particulars of the food and drink she had left for him she finished with the following words : "" i see that as long as you remain here you will never be able to set me free; if however you still wish to do so come to the golden castle of stromberg; this is well within your power to accomplish .",sadness
"when the man awoke and found that he had been sleeping he was grieved at heart and said "" she has no doubt been here and driven away again and it is now too late for me to save her .",sadness
then his eyes fell on the things which were lying beside him; he read the letter and knew from it all that had happened .,sadness
he rose up without delay eager to start on his way and to reach the castle of stromberg but he had no idea in which direction he ought to go .,surprise
again the next day he pursued his way through the forest and that evening thinking to rest again he lay down as before but he heard such a howling and wailing that he found it impossible to sleep .,surprise
he waited till it was darker and people had begun to light up their houses and then seeing a little glimmer ahead of him he went towards it .,surprise
he found that the light came from a house which looked smaller than it really was from the contrast of its height with that of an immense giant who stood in front of it .,surprise
"when the giant saw him he called out "" it is lucky for that you have come for i have not had anything to eat for a long time .",joy
i can have you now for my supper .,joy
"if that is so "" replied the giant "" i will leave you in peace; i only thought of eating you because i had nothing else .",joy
so they went indoors together and sat down and the man brought out the bread meat and wine which although he had eaten and drunk of them were still unconsumed .,joy
"the giant was pleased with the good cheer and ate and drank to his heart "" s content .",joy
"never mind "" he said "" i have larger maps upstairs in the cupboard we will look on those "" but they searched in vain for the castle was not marked even on these .",anger
the man now thought he should like to continue his journey but the giant begged him to remain for a day or two longer until the return of his brother who was away in search of provisions .,sadness
accordingly when he had finished his supper they all went up together to his room and looked through his maps but the castle was not to be found .,anger
then he fetched other older maps and they went on looking for the castle until at last they found it but it was many thousand miles away .,sadness
"how shall i be able to get there ? "" asked the man .",sadness
"i have two hours to spare "" said the giant "" and i will carry you into the neighbourhood of the castle; i must then return to look after the child who is in our care .",surprise
he found it situated however on a glass mountain and looking up from the foot he saw the enchanted maiden drive round her castle and then go inside .,surprise
he was overjoyed to see her and longed to get to the top of the mountain but the sides were so slippery that every time he attempted to climb he fell back again .,joy
"when he saw that it was impossible to reach her he was greatly grieved and said to himself "" i will remain here and wait for her "" so he built himself a little hut and there he sat and watched for a whole year and every day he saw the king "" s daughter driving round her castle but still was unable to get nearer to her .",sadness
they stopped when they heard the call but looking round and seeing nobody they went on again with their fighting which now became more furious .,anger
"god be with you "" he cried again and again they paused and looked about but seeing no one went back to their fighting .",anger
"a third time he called out "" god be with you "" and then thinking he should like to know the cause of dispute between the three men he went out and asked them why they were fighting so angrily with one another .",surprise
they had been unable to decide whether they would keep together and have the things in common or whether they would separate .,anger
"on hearing this the man said "" i will give you something in exchange for those three things; not money for that i have not got but something that is of far more value .",surprise
"then he fell upon them with the stick and beat them one after another crying "" there you idle vagabonds you have got what you deserve; are you satisfied now !",joy
"that is my own ring "" she exclaimed "" and if that is so the man must also be here who is coming to set me free .",surprise
she sought for him about the castle but could find him nowhere .,sadness
when therefore she came to the castle gate she saw him and cried aloud for joy .,joy
"then he dismounted and took her in his arms; and she kissed him and said "" now you have indeed set me free and tomorrow we will celebrate our marriage .",joy
but the girl did not care for the man as a girl ought to care for her betrothed husband .,sadness
she did not feel that she could trust him and she could not look at him nor think of him without an inward shudder .,anger
"ah you poor child "" answered the old woman "" what a place for you to come to !",sadness
if i did not take pity on you and save you you would be lost .,sadness
i have long been waiting for an opportunity to escape .,sadness
they gave her wine to drink three glasses full one of white wine one of red and one of yellow and with that her heart gave way and she died .,sadness
"as a merry young huntsman was once going briskly along through a wood there came up a little old woman and said to him "" good day good day; you seem merry enough but i am hungry and thirsty; do pray give me something to eat .",sadness
the huntsman took pity on her and put his hand in his pocket and gave her what he had .,sadness
"then he wanted to go his way; but she took hold of him and said "" listen my friend to what i am going to tell you; i will reward you for your kindness; go your way and after a little time you will come to a tree where you will see nine birds sitting on a cloak .",joy
shoot into the midst of them and one will fall down dead : the cloak will fall too; take it it is a wishing cloak and when you wear it you will find yourself at any place where you may wish to be .,joy
cut open the dead bird take out its heart and keep it and you will find a piece of gold under your pillow every morning when you rise .,joy
"it is the bird "" s heart that will bring you this good luck .",joy
"the huntsman thanked her and thought to himself "" if all this does happen it will be a fine thing for me .",joy
when he had gone a hundred steps or so he heard a screaming and chirping in the branches over him and looked up and saw a flock of birds pulling a cloak with their bills and feet; screaming fighting and tugging at each other as if each wished to have it himself .,anger
"well "" said the huntsman "" this is wonderful; this happens just as the old woman said "" ; then he shot into the midst of them so that their feathers flew all about .",joy
the next morning when he awoke he lifted up his pillow and there lay the piece of gold glittering underneath; the same happened next day and indeed every day when he arose .,joy
"he heaped up a great deal of gold and at last thought to himself "" of what use is this gold to me whilst i am at home ?",sadness
i will go out into the world and look about me .,joy
then he took leave of his friends and hung his bag and bow about his neck and went his way .,joy
"now the old woman was a witch and said to the young lady "" there is a young man coming out of the wood who carries a wonderful prize; we must get it away from him my dear child for it is more fit for us than for him .",anger
"meantime the huntsman came nearer and looked at the lady and said to himself "" i have been travelling so long that i should like to go into this castle and rest myself for i have money enough to pay for anything i want "" ; but the real reason was that he wanted to see more of the beautiful lady .",surprise
"then he went into the house and was welcomed kindly; and it was not long before he was so much in love that he thought of nothing else but looking at the lady "" s eyes and doing everything that she wished .",joy
"then the old woman said "" now is the time for getting the bird "" s heart .",anger
"so the lady stole it away and he never found any more gold under his pillow for it lay now under the young lady "" s and the old woman took it away every morning; but he was so much in love that he never missed his prize .",joy
"well "" said the old witch "" we have got the bird "" s heart but not the wishing cloak yet and that we must also get .",anger
"let us leave him that "" said the young lady; "" he has already lost his wealth .",sadness
"then the witch was very angry and said "" such a cloak is a very rare and wonderful thing and i must and will have it .",anger
"so she did as the old woman told her and set herself at the window and looked about the country and seemed very sorrowful; then the huntsman said "" what makes you so sad ?",surprise
"alas ! dear sir "" said she "" yonder lies the granite rock where all the costly diamonds grow and i want so much to go there that whenever i think of it i cannot help being sorrowful for who can reach it ? only the birds and the flies man cannot .",sadness
"if that "" s all your grief "" said the huntsman "" i "" ll take there with all my heart "" ; so he drew her under his cloak and the moment he wished to be on the granite mountain they were both there .",joy
the diamonds glittered so on all sides that they were delighted with the sight and picked up the finest .,joy
"but the old witch made a deep sleep come upon him and he said to the young lady "" let us sit down and rest ourselves a little i am so tired that i cannot stand any longer .",sadness
so they sat down and he laid his head in her lap and fell asleep; and whilst he was sleeping on she took the cloak from his shoulders hung it on her own picked up the diamonds and wished herself home again .,joy
"when he awoke and found that his lady had tricked him and left him alone on the wild rock he said "" alas ! what roguery there is in the world ! "" and there he sat in great grief and fear not knowing what to do .",sadness
"when the giants came up to him the first pushed him with his foot and said "" what worm is this that lies here curled up ?",anger
"tread upon him and kill him "" said the second .",anger
"it "" s not worth the trouble "" said the third; "" let him live he "" ll go climbing higher up the mountain and some cloud will come rolling and carry him away .",anger
"then he looked around him and said "" i wish i had something to eat if not i shall be worse off than before; for here i see neither apples nor pears nor any kind of fruits nothing but vegetables .",sadness
"at last he thought to himself "" i can eat salad it will refresh and strengthen me .",joy
so he picked out a fine head and ate of it; but scarcely had he swallowed two bites when he felt himself quite changed and saw with horror that he was turned into an ass .,surprise
however he still felt very hungry and the salad tasted very nice; so he ate on till he came to another kind of salad and scarcely had he tasted it when he felt another change come over him and soon saw that he was lucky enough to have found his old shape again .,joy
"then he laid himself down and slept off a little of his weariness; and when he awoke the next morning he broke off a head both of the good and the bad salad and thought to himself "" this will help me to my fortune again and enable me to pay off some folks for their treachery .",joy
so he went away to try and find the castle of his friends; and after wandering about a few days he luckily found it .,joy
"then he stained his face all over brown so that even his mother would not have known him and went into the castle and asked for a lodging; "" i am so tired "" said he "" that i can go no farther .",sadness
"countryman "" said the witch "" who are you ? and what is your business ?",anger
"i have been lucky enough to find it and have brought it with me; but the heat of the sun scorches so that it begins to wither and i don "" t know that i can carry it farther .",sadness
"when the witch and the young lady heard of his beautiful salad they longed to taste it and said "" dear countryman let us just taste it .",surprise
"the messenger sat all this time with the beautiful young lady and as nobody came with the salad and she longed to taste it she said "" i don "" t know where the salad can be .",sadness
"then he thought something must have happened and said "" i will go into the kitchen and see .",surprise
and as he went he saw two asses in the court running about and the salad lying on the ground .,joy
"all right ! "" said he; "" those two have had their share .",joy
"then he took up the rest of the leaves laid them on the dish and brought them to the young lady saying "" i bring you the dish myself that you may not wait any longer .",joy
then the huntsman washed his face and went into the court that they might know him .,joy
"now you shall be paid for your roguery "" said he; and tied them all three to a rope and took them along with him till he came to a mill and knocked at the window .",anger
"i have three tiresome beasts here "" said the other; "" if you will take them give them food and room and treat them as i tell you i will pay you whatever you ask .",anger
"with all my heart "" said the miller; "" but how shall i treat them ?",surprise
"then the huntsman said "" give the old one stripes three times a day and hay once; give the next ( who was the servant maid ) stripes once a day and hay three times; and give the youngest ( who was the beautiful lady ) hay three times a day and no stripes "" : for he could not find it in his heart to have her beaten .",anger
after this he went back to the castle where he found everything he wanted .,joy
"some days after the miller came to him and told him that the old ass was dead; "" the other two "" said he "" are alive and eat but are so sorrowful that they cannot last long .",sadness
then the huntsman pitied them and told the miller to drive them back to him and when they came he gave them some of the good salad to eat .,sadness
"and the beautiful young lady fell upon her knees before him and said "" o dearest huntsman ! forgive me all the ill i have done you; my mother forced me to it it was against my will for i always loved you very much .",sadness
"but he said "" keep it it will be just the same thing for i mean to make you my wife .",joy
so they were married and lived together very happily till they died .,joy
although the little girl was very pretty she was so weak and small that they thought she could not live; but they said she should at once be christened .,sadness
"surely "" said he "" the whole seven must have forgotten themselves over some game of play "" ; and when he had waited still longer and they yet did not come he flew into a rage and wished them all turned into ravens .",anger
sorry as he was to see his wish so fulfilled he did not know how what was done could be undone and comforted himself as well as he could for the loss of his seven sons with his dear little daughter who soon became stronger and every day more beautiful .,sadness
for a long time she did not know that she had ever had any brothers; for her father and mother took care not to speak of them before her : but one day by chance she heard the people about her speak of them .,surprise
then she was much grieved and went to her father and mother and asked if she had any brothers and what had become of them .,sadness
so they dared no longer hide the truth from her but said it was the will of heaven and that her birth was only the innocent cause of it; but the little girl mourned sadly about it every day and thought herself bound to do all she could to bring her brothers back; and she had neither rest nor ease till at length one day she stole away and set out into the wide world to find her brothers wherever they might be and free them whatever it might cost her .,sadness
then she felt for the little piece of wood; but when she unwrapped the cloth it was not there and she saw she had lost the gift of the good stars .,sadness
she wanted to save her brothers and had no key of the castle of the glass mountain; so this faithful little sister took a knife out of her pocket and cut off her little finger that was just the size of the piece of wood she had lost and put it in the door and opened it .,sadness
"then the dwarf said "" my masters are not at home; but if you will wait till they come pray step in .",sadness
now the little dwarf was getting their dinner ready and he brought their food upon seven little plates and their drink in seven little glasses and set them upon the table and out of each little plate their sister ate a small piece and out of each little glass she drank a small drop; but she let the ring that she had brought with her fall into the last glass .,sadness
when they came in they wanted to eat and drink and looked for their little plates and glasses .,anger
who has eaten from my little plate ?,anger
and who has been drinking out of my little glass ?,anger
caw !,anger
caw ! well i ween mortal lips have this way been .,anger
"when the seventh came to the bottom of his glass and found there the ring he looked at it and knew that it was his father "" s and mother "" s and said "" o that our little sister would but come ! then we should be free .",sadness
when the little girl heard this ( for she stood behind the door all the time and listened ) she ran forward and in an instant all the ravens took their right form again; and all hugged and kissed each other and went merrily home .,joy
that too must be an art of which i understand nothing !,sadness
look how your brother works but you do not even earn your salt .,anger
"well father "" he replied "" i am quite willing to learn something indeed if it could but be managed i should like to learn how to shudder .",joy
"i don "" t understand that at all yet .",sadness
"the elder brother smiled when he heard that and thought to himself : "" goodness what a blockhead that brother of mine is !",anger
he will never be good for anything as long as he lives !,anger
"the father sighed and answered him : "" you shall soon learn what it is to shudder but you will not earn your bread by that .",anger
soon after this the sexton came to the house on a visit and the father bewailed his trouble and told him how his younger son was so backward in every respect that he knew nothing and learnt nothing .,sadness
"just think "" said he "" when i asked him how he was going to earn his bread he actually wanted to learn to shudder .",anger
"if that be all "" replied the sexton "" he can learn that with me .",surprise
"the father was glad to do it for he thought : "" it will train the boy a little .",joy
"you shall soon learn what shuddering is "" thought he and secretly went there before him; and when the boy was at the top of the tower and turned round and was just going to take hold of the bell rope he saw a white figure standing on the stairs opposite the sounding hole .",anger
"who is there ? "" cried he but the figure made no reply and did not move or stir .",surprise
"give an answer "" cried the boy "" or take yourself off you have no business here at night .",anger
"the boy cried a second time : "" what do you want here ? speak if you are an honest fellow or i will throw you down the steps !",anger
"the sexton thought : "" he can "" t mean to be as bad as his words "" uttered no sound and stood as if he were made of stone .",surprise
then the boy called to him for the third time and as that was also to no purpose he ran against him and pushed the ghost down the stairs so that it fell down the ten steps and remained lying there in a corner .,anger
"no i don "" t know "" replied the boy "" but someone was standing by the sounding hole on the other side of the steps and as he would neither gave an answer nor go away i took him for a scoundrel and threw him downstairs .",surprise
just go there and you will see if it was he .,anger
i should be sorry if it were .,sadness
"she carried him down and then with loud screams she hastened to the boy "" s father "" your boy "" cried she "" has been the cause of a great misfortune !",anger
he has thrown my husband down the steps so that he broke his leg .,anger
take the good for nothing fellow out of our house .,anger
"what wicked tricks are these ? "" said he .",anger
the devil must have put them into your head .,anger
i am quite innocent .,anger
he was standing there by night like one intent on doing evil .,anger
i did not know who it was and i entreated him three times either to speak or to go away .,anger
"ah "" said the father "" i have nothing but unhappiness with you .",anger
go out of my sight .,anger
i will see you no more .,anger
yes father right willingly wait only until it is day .,sadness
"learn what you will "" spoke the father "" it is all the same to me .",anger
take these and go into the wide world and tell no one from whence you come and who is your father for i have reason to be ashamed of you .,anger
yes father it shall be as you will .,sadness
"when the day dawned therefore the boy put his fifty talers into his pocket and went forth on the great highway and continually said to himself : "" if i could but shudder !",sadness
if i could but shudder !,sadness
"if that is all that is wanted "" answered the youth "" it is easily done; but if i learn how to shudder as fast as that you shall have my fifty talers .",surprise
and as he was cold he lighted himself a fire but at midnight the wind blew so sharply that in spite of his fire he could not get warm .,sadness
"and as the wind knocked the hanged men against each other and they moved backwards and forwards he thought to himself : "" if you shiver below by the fire how those up above must freeze and suffer !",sadness
and as he felt pity for them he raised the ladder and climbed up unbound one of them after the other and brought down all seven .,sadness
but they sat there and did not stir and the fire caught their clothes .,surprise
"so he said : "" take care or i will hang you up again .",anger
"at this he grew angry and said : "" if you will not take care i cannot help you i will not be burnt with you "" and he hung them up again each in his turn .",anger
"then he sat down by his fire and fell asleep and the next morning the man came to him and wanted to have the fifty talers and said : "" well do you know how to shudder ?",anger
"no "" answered he "" how should i know ?",anger
those fellows up there did not open their mouths and were so stupid that they let the few old rags which they had on their bodies get burnt .,anger
"then the man saw that he would not get the fifty talers that day and went away saying : "" such a youth has never come my way before .",surprise
"the youth likewise went his way and once more began to mutter to himself : "" ah if i could but shudder !",sadness
ah if i could but shudder !,sadness
"i don "" t know "" answered the youth .",sadness
i know not .,sadness
that i may not tell you .,sadness
what is it that you are always muttering between your teeth ?,anger
"ah "" replied the youth "" i do so wish i could shudder but no one can teach me how .",sadness
"enough of your foolish chatter "" said the waggoner .",anger
"then at the entrance of the parlour the youth again said quite loudly : "" if i could but shudder !",sadness
if i could but shudder !,sadness
"the host who heard this laughed and said : "" if that is your desire there ought to be a good opportunity for you here .",surprise
"but the youth said : "" however difficult it may be i will learn it .",sadness
he let the host have no rest until the latter told him that not far from thence stood a haunted castle where anyone could very easily learn what shuddering was if he would but watch in it for three nights .,anger
"then the youth went next morning to the king and said : "" if it be allowed i will willingly watch three nights in the haunted castle .",joy
"the king looked at him and as the youth pleased him he said : "" you may ask for three things to take into the castle with you but they must be things without life .",joy
"ah if i could but shudder ! "" said he "" but i shall not learn it here either .",sadness
"towards midnight he was about to poke his fire and as he was blowing it something cried suddenly from one corner : "" au miau ! how cold we are !",anger
"you fools ! "" cried he "" what are you crying about ?",anger
if you are cold come and take a seat by the fire and warm yourselves .,anger
and when he had said that two great black cats came with one tremendous leap and sat down on each side of him and looked savagely at him with their fiery eyes .,anger
"oh "" said he "" what long nails you have !",surprise
thereupon he seized them by the throats put them on the cutting board and screwed their feet fast .,anger
"i have looked at your fingers "" said he "" and my fancy for card playing has gone "" and he struck them dead and threw them out into the water .",anger
but when he had made away with these two and was about to sit down again by his fire out from every hole and corner came black cats and black dogs with red hot chains and more and more of them came until he could no longer move and they yelled horribly and got on his fire pulled it to pieces and tried to put it out .,anger
"he watched them for a while quietly but at last when they were going too far he seized his cutting knife and cried : "" away with you vermin "" and began to cut them down .",anger
some of them ran away the others he killed and threw out into the fish pond .,anger
then he looked round and saw a great bed in the corner .,joy
"that is the very thing for me "" said he and got into it .",joy
"that "" s right "" said he "" but go faster .",surprise
then the bed rolled on as if six horses were harnessed to it up and down over thresholds and stairs but suddenly hop hop it turned over upside down and lay on him like a mountain .,surprise
"then said he : "" after all it is a pity for so handsome a man .",sadness
"the youth heard it got up and said : "" it has not come to that yet .",joy
then the king was astonished but very glad and asked how he had fared .,surprise
"very well indeed "" answered he; "" one night is past the two others will pass likewise .",joy
"then he went to the innkeeper who opened his eyes very wide and said : "" i never expected to see you alive again !",surprise
have you learnt how to shudder yet ?,surprise
"no "" said he "" it is all in vain .",sadness
if someone would but tell me !,sadness
"the second night he again went up into the old castle sat down by the fire and once more began his old song : "" if i could but shudder !",sadness
"hullo ! "" cried he "" another half belongs to this .",joy
this is not enough !,anger
"wait "" said he "" i will just stoke up the fire a little for you .",sadness
"that is no part of our bargain "" said the youth "" the bench is mine .",anger
the man wanted to push him away; the youth however would not allow that but thrust him off with all his strength and seated himself again in his own place .,anger
"the youth also wanted to play and said : "" listen you can i join you ?",surprise
"money enough "" replied he "" but your balls are not quite round .",surprise
"there now they will roll better ! "" said he .",joy
"hurrah ! now we "" ll have fun !",joy
he played with them and lost some of his money but when it struck twelve everything vanished from his sight .,joy
"how has it fared with you this time ? "" asked he .",surprise
"i have been playing at ninepins "" he answered "" and have lost a couple of farthings .",sadness
have you not shuddered then ?,surprise
"what ? "" said he "" i have had a wonderful time !",joy
if i did but know what it was to shudder !,sadness
"the third night he sat down again on his bench and said quite sadly : "" if i could but shudder .",sadness
"then he said : "" ha ha that is certainly my little cousin who died only a few days ago "" and he beckoned with his finger and cried : "" come little cousin come .",joy
he felt his face but it was cold as ice .,anger
"wait "" said he "" i will warm you a little "" and went to the fire and warmed his hand and laid it on the dead man "" s face but he remained cold .",surprise
then he took him out and sat down by the fire and laid him on his breast and rubbed his arms that the blood might circulate again .,surprise
"as this also did no good he thought to himself : "" when two people lie in bed together they warm each other "" and carried him to the bed covered him over and lay down by him .",surprise
"then said the youth "" see little cousin have i not warmed you ?",joy
"the dead man however got up and cried : "" now will i strangle you .",anger
"what ! "" said he "" is that the way you thank me ?",anger
"you shall at once go into your coffin again "" and he took him up threw him into it and shut the lid .",anger
"i cannot manage to shudder "" said he .",anger
i shall never learn it here as long as i live .,sadness
"you wretch "" cried he "" you shall soon learn what it is to shudder for you shall die .",anger
"not so fast "" replied the youth .",anger
if i am to die i shall have to have a say in it .,anger
"i will soon seize you "" said the fiend .",anger
softly softly do not talk so big .,anger
i am as strong as you are and perhaps even stronger .,anger
"we shall see "" said the old man .",anger
if you are stronger i will let you go come we will try .,anger
"then he led him by dark passages to a smith "" s forge took an axe and with one blow struck an anvil into the ground .",anger
"i can do better than that "" said the youth and went to the other anvil .",anger
"then the youth seized the axe split the anvil with one blow and in it caught the old man "" s beard .",anger
"now i have you "" said the youth .",joy
now it is your turn to die .,anger
then he seized an iron bar and beat the old man till he moaned and entreated him to stop when he would give him great riches .,anger
the youth drew out the axe and let him go .,surprise
the old man led him back into the castle and in a cellar showed him three chests full of gold .,joy
in the meantime it struck twelve and the spirit disappeared so that the youth stood in darkness .,joy
"i shall still be able to find my way out "" said he and felt about found the way into the room and slept there by his fire .",joy
"no "" he answered; "" what can it be ?",sadness
my dead cousin was here and a bearded man came and showed me a great deal of money down below but no one told me what it was to shudder .,sadness
"then "" said the king "" you have saved the castle and shall marry my daughter .",joy
"that is all very well "" said he "" but still i do not know what it is to shudder !",sadness
"then the gold was brought up and the wedding celebrated; but howsoever much the young king loved his wife and however happy he was he still said always : "" if i could but shudder if i could but shudder .",joy
and this at last angered her .,anger
"her waiting maid said : "" i will find a cure for him; he shall soon learn what it is to shudder .",anger
at night when the young king was sleeping his wife was to draw the clothes off him and empty the bucket full of cold water with the gudgeons in it over him so that the little fishes would sprawl about him .,anger
ah ! now i know what it is to shudder !,joy
"then the straw began and said : "" dear friends from whence do you come here ?",surprise
"the coal replied : "" i fortunately sprang out of the fire and if i had not escaped by sheer force my death would have been certain i should have been burnt to ashes .",joy
"the bean said : "" i too have escaped with a whole skin but if the old woman had got me into the pan i should have been made into broth without any mercy like my comrades .",joy
the old woman has destroyed all my brethren in fire and smoke; she seized sixty of them at once and took their lives .,sadness
i luckily slipped through her fingers .,joy
the proposition pleased the two others and they set out on their way together .,joy
the bean who had prudently stayed behind on the shore could not but laugh at the event was unable to stop and laughed so heartily that she burst .,surprise
it would have been all over with her likewise if by good fortune a tailor who was travelling in search of work had not sat down to rest by the brook .,surprise
as he had a compassionate heart he pulled out his needle and thread and sewed her together .,joy
the bean thanked him most prettily but as the tailor used black thread all beans since then have a black seam .,joy
"then said the father : "" hark you my son try as i will i can get nothing into your head .",anger
you must go from hence i will give you into the care of a celebrated master who shall see what he can do with you .,sadness
"lord have mercy on us ! "" cried the father; "" is that all you have learnt ?",anger
i will send you into another town to another master .,anger
"then the father fell into a rage and said : "" oh you lost man you have spent the precious time and learnt nothing; are you not ashamed to appear before my eyes ?",anger
i will send you to a third master but if you learn nothing this time also i will no longer be your father .,anger
"then the father fell into the most furious anger sprang up called his people thither and said : "" this man is no longer my son i drive him forth and command you to take him out into the forest and kill him .",anger
they took him forth but when they should have killed him they could not do it for pity and let him go and they cut the eyes and tongue out of a deer that they might carry them to the old man as a token .,sadness
"the youth wandered on and after some time came to a fortress where he begged for a night "" s lodging .",sadness
the whole district was in sorrow and dismay because of them and yet no one could do anything to stop this .,sadness
when he went inside the dogs did not bark at him but wagged their tails quite amicably around him ate what he set before them and did not hurt one hair of his head .,joy
"next morning to the astonishment of everyone he came out again safe and unharmed and said to the lord of the castle : "" the dogs have revealed to me in their own language why they dwell there and bring evil on the land .",surprise
then all who heard this rejoiced and the lord of the castle said he would adopt him as a son if he accomplished it successfully .,joy
he went down again and as he knew what he had to do he did it thoroughly and brought a chest full of gold out with him .,joy
the howling of the wild dogs was henceforth heard no more; they had disappeared and the country was freed from the trouble .,joy
he listened to them and when he became aware of what they were saying he grew very thoughtful and sad .,sadness
at last he arrived in rome where the pope had just died and there was great doubt among the cardinals as to whom they should appoint as his successor .,sadness
and just as that was decided on the young count entered into the church and suddenly two snow white doves flew on his shoulders and remained sitting there .,surprise
the ecclesiastics recognized therein the token from above and asked him on the spot if he would be pope .,surprise
then was he anointed and consecrated and thus was fulfilled what he had heard from the frogs on his way which had so affected him that he was to be his holiness the pope .,joy
then he had to sing a mass and did not know one word of it but the two doves sat continually on his shoulders and said it all in his ear .,joy
"what makes you pant so my friend ? "" said the ass .",surprise
"alas ! "" said the dog "" my master was going to knock me on the head because i am old and weak and can no longer make myself useful to him in hunting; so i ran away; but what can i do to earn my livelihood ?",sadness
"hark ye ! "" said the ass "" i am going to the great city to turn musician : suppose you go with me and try what you can do in the same way ?",joy
the dog said he was willing and they jogged on together .,joy
they had not gone far before they saw a cat sitting in the middle of the road and making a most rueful face .,sadness
"pray my good lady "" said the ass "" what "" s the matter with you ?",surprise
you look quite out of spirits !,surprise
because i am beginning to grow old and had rather lie at my ease by the fire than run about the house after the mice my mistress laid hold of me and was going to drown me; and though i have been lucky enough to get away from her i do not know what i am to live upon .,sadness
"oh "" said the ass "" by all means go with us to the great city; you are a good night singer and may make your fortune as a musician .",joy
the cat was pleased with the thought and joined the party .,joy
soon afterwards as they were passing by a farmyard they saw a cock perched upon a gate and screaming out with all his might and main .,surprise
"bravo ! "" said the ass; "" upon my word you make a famous noise; pray what is all this about ?",joy
"heaven forbid ! "" said the ass "" come with us master chanticleer; it will be better at any rate than staying here to have your head cut off !",surprise
if we care to sing in tune we may get up some kind of a concert; so come along with us .,joy
"with all my heart "" said the cock : so they all four went on jollily together .",joy
"in doing this he saw afar off something bright and shining and calling to his companions said "" there must be a house no great way off for i see a light .",surprise
"if that be the case "" said the ass "" we had better change our quarters for our lodging is not the best in the world !",surprise
"besides "" added the dog "" i should not be the worse for a bone or two or a bit of meat .",joy
why i see a table spread with all kinds of good things and robbers sitting round it making merry .,surprise
"that would be a noble lodging for us "" said the cock .",joy
"yes "" said the ass "" if we could only get in "" ; so they consulted together how they should contrive to get the robbers out; and at last they hit upon a plan .",joy
the ass brayed the dog barked the cat mewed and the cock screamed; and then they all broke through the window at once and came tumbling into the room amongst the broken glass with a most hideous clatter !,surprise
the coast once clear our travellers soon sat down and dispatched what the robbers had left with as much eagerness as if they had not expected to eat again for a month .,joy
as soon as they had satisfied themselves they put out the lights and each once more sought out a resting place to his own liking .,joy
but about midnight when the robbers saw from afar that the lights were out and that all seemed quiet they began to think that they had been in too great a hurry to run away; and one of them who was bolder than the rest went to see what was going on .,anger
but the cat not understanding this joke sprang at his face and spat and scratched at him .,anger
after this the robbers never dared to go back to the house; but the musicians were so pleased with their quarters that they took up their abode there; and there they are i dare say at this very day .,joy
when the seed came up there was one plant bigger than all the rest; and it kept getting larger and larger and seemed as if it would never cease growing; so that it might have been called the prince of turnips for there never was such a one seen before and never will again .,surprise
at last it was so big that it filled a cart and two oxen could hardly draw it; and the gardener knew not what in the world to do with it nor whether it would be a blessing or a curse to him .,surprise
"one day he said to himself "" what shall i do with it ? if i sell it it will bring no more than another; and for eating the little turnips are better than this; the best thing perhaps is to carry it and give it to the king as a mark of respect .",anger
"what a wonderful thing ! "" said the king; "" i have seen many strange things but such a monster as this i never saw .",joy
where did you get the seed ? or is it only your good luck ?,surprise
if so you are a true child of fortune .,surprise
"ah no ! "" answered the gardener "" i am no child of fortune; i am a poor soldier who never could get enough to live upon; so i laid aside my red coat and set to work tilling the ground .",sadness
i have a brother who is rich and your majesty knows him well and all the world knows him; but because i am poor everybody forgets me .,sadness
"the king then took pity on him and said "" you shall be poor no longer .",sadness
i will give you so much that you shall be even richer than your brother .,joy
"then he gave him gold and lands and flocks and made him so rich that his brother "" s fortune could not at all be compared with his .",joy
when the brother heard of all this and how a turnip had made the gardener so rich he envied him sorely and bethought himself how he could contrive to get the same good fortune for himself .,anger
however he determined to manage more cleverly than his brother and got together a rich present of gold and fine horses for the king; and thought he must have a much larger gift in return; for if his brother had received so much for only a turnip what must his present be wroth ?,anger
the king took the gift very graciously and said he knew not what to give in return more valuable and wonderful than the great turnip; so the soldier was forced to put it into a cart and drag it home with him .,surprise
when he reached home he knew not upon whom to vent his rage and spite; and at length wicked thoughts came into his head and he resolved to kill his brother .,anger
"so he hired some villains to murder him; and having shown them where to lie in ambush he went to his brother and said "" dear brother i have found a hidden treasure; let us go and dig it up and share it between us .",anger
the other had no suspicions of his roguery : so they went out together and as they were travelling along the murderers rushed out upon him bound him and were going to hang him on a tree .,surprise
when the horseman came up he proved to be a student a merry fellow who was journeying along on his nag and singing as he went .,joy
"as soon as the man in the sack saw him passing under the tree he cried out "" good morning ! good morning to thee my friend !",surprise
"then the man in the tree answered "" lift up thine eyes for behold here i sit in the sack of wisdom; here have i in a short time learned great and wondrous things .",joy
a little longer and i shall know all that man can know and shall come forth wiser than the wisest of mankind .,joy
here i discern the signs and motions of the heavens and the stars; the laws that control the winds; the number of the sands on the seashore; the healing of the sick; the virtues of all simples of birds and of precious stones .,joy
wert thou but once here my friend though wouldst feel and own the power of knowledge .,joy
"the student listened to all this and wondered much; at last he said "" blessed be the day and hour when i found you; cannot you contrive to let me into the sack for a little while ?",joy
"then the other answered as if very unwillingly "" a little space i may allow thee to sit here if thou wilt reward me well and entreat me kindly; but thou must tarry yet an hour below till i have learnt some little matters that are yet unknown to me .",joy
so the student sat himself down and waited a while; but the time hung heavy upon him and he begged earnestly that he might ascend forthwith for his thirst for knowledge was great .,anger
"then the other pretended to give way and said "" thou must let the sack of wisdom descend by untying yonder cord and then thou shalt enter .",anger
so the student let him down opened the sack and set him free .,joy
"now then "" cried he "" let me ascend quickly .",joy
then he pushed him in head first tied up the sack and soon swung up the searcher after wisdom dangling in the air .,surprise
"how is it with thee friend ? "" said he "" dost thou not feel that wisdom comes unto thee ?",joy
rest there in peace till thou art a wiser man than thou wert .,anger
"so saying he trotted off on the student "" s nag and left the poor fellow to gather wisdom till somebody should come and let him down .",anger
he was well entertained and in the evening was taken to the chamber next to the one where the princesses lay in their twelve beds .,joy
"i hardly know where i am going or what i had better do "" said the soldier; "" but i think i should like very well to find out where it is that the princesses dance and then in time i might be a king .",sadness
when the soldier heard all this good counsel he determined to try his luck : so he went to the king and said he was willing to undertake the task .,joy
he was as well received as the others had been and the king ordered fine royal robes to be given him; and when the evening came he was led to the outer chamber .,joy
"when the twelve princesses heard this they laughed heartily; and the eldest said "" this fellow too might have done a wiser thing than lose his life in this way !",joy
then they rose up and opened their drawers and boxes and took out all their fine clothes and dressed themselves at the glass and skipped about as if they were eager to begin dancing .,joy
"you simpleton "" said the eldest "" you are always afraid; have you forgotten how many kings "" sons have already watched in vain ?",anger
"you silly creature ! "" said the eldest "" it is nothing but a nail in the wall .",anger
"as they were rowing over the lake the prince who was in the boat with the youngest princess and the soldier said "" i do not know why it is but though i am rowing with all my might we do not get on so fast as usual and i am quite tired : the boat seems very heavy today .",surprise
"it is only the heat of the weather "" said the princess : "" i feel it very warm too .",sadness
in the morning the soldier said nothing about what had happened but determined to see more of this strange adventure and went again the second and third night; and every thing happened just as before; the princesses danced each time till their shoes were worn to pieces and then returned home .,joy
and when he was sitting beside her and very happy news came that his father lay sick unto death and desired to see him once again before his end .,sadness
"then he said to his beloved : "" i must now go and leave you i give you a ring as a remembrance of me .",sadness
when i am king i will return and fetch you .,sadness
"the son was in such trouble that he did not think what he was doing and said : "" yes dear father your will shall be done "" and thereupon the king shut his eyes and died .",sadness
"when therefore the son had been proclaimed king and the time of mourning was over he was forced to keep the promise which he had given his father and caused the king "" s daughter to be asked in marriage and she was promised to him .",sadness
his first betrothed heard of this and fretted so much about his faithfulness that she nearly died .,sadness
thereupon she took her leave of her father and rode away with them and rode to the court of her former betrothed whom she loved so dearly .,sadness
"the king looked at her and did not know her but as they were such handsome fellows he said : "" yes "" and that he would willingly take them and now they were the king "" s twelve huntsmen .",joy
"it came to pass that one evening he said to the king : "" you think you have twelve huntsmen ?",anger
"the lion continued : "" you are mistaken they are twelve girls .",anger
"the king said : "" that cannot be true !",anger
how will you prove that to me ?,anger
men have a firm step and when they walk over peas none of them stir but girls trip and skip and drag their feet and the peas roll about .,anger
the king was well pleased with the counsel and caused the peas to be strewn .,joy
"then they went away again and the king said to the lion : "" you have lied to me they walk just like men .",surprise
"the lion said : "" they have been informed that they were going to be put to the test and have assumed some strength .",anger
the king liked the advice and had the spinning wheels placed in the ante chamber .,joy
"then the king again said to the lion : "" you have deceived me they are men for they have not looked at the spinning wheels .",surprise
the king however would no longer believe the lion .,anger
the twelve huntsmen always followed the king to the chase and his liking for them continually increased .,joy
when the true bride heard that it hurt her so much that her heart was almost broken and she fell fainting to the ground .,sadness
then he saw the ring which he had given to his first bride and when he looked in her face he recognized her .,surprise
"then his heart was so touched that he kissed her and when she opened her eyes he said : "" you are mine and i am yours and no one in the world can alter that .",joy
thereupon the wedding was celebrated and the lion was again taken into favour because after all he had told the truth .,joy
"one summer "" s morning a little tailor was sitting on his table by the window; he was in good spirits and sewed with all his might .",joy
"this rang pleasantly in the tailor "" s ears; he stretched his delicate head out of the window and called : "" come up here dear woman; here you will get rid of your goods .",joy
"he inspected each one lifted it up put his nose to it and at length said : "" the jam seems to me to be good so weigh me out four ounces dear woman and if it is a quarter of a pound that is of no consequence .",joy
the woman who had hoped to find a good sale gave him what he desired but went away quite angry and grumbling .,anger
"now this jam shall be blessed by god "" cried the little tailor "" and give me health and strength "" ; so he brought the bread out of the cupboard cut himself a piece right across the loaf and spread the jam over it .",joy
he laid the bread near him sewed on and in his joy made bigger and bigger stitches .,joy
in the meantime the smell of the sweet jam rose to where the flies were sitting in great numbers and they were attracted and descended on it in hosts .,joy
"hi ! who invited you ? "" said the little tailor and drove the unbidden guests away .",joy
"the little tailor at last lost all patience and drew a piece of cloth from the hole under his work table and saying : "" wait and i will give it to you "" struck it mercilessly on them .",anger
"are you a fellow of that sort ? "" said he and could not help admiring his own bravery .",joy
the whole town shall know of this !,joy
"and the little tailor hastened to cut himself a girdle stitched it and embroidered on it in large letters : "" seven at one stroke !",joy
"what the town ! "" he continued "" the whole world shall hear of it ! "" and his heart wagged with joy like a lamb "" s tail .",joy
the tailor put on the girdle and resolved to go forth into the world because he thought his workshop was too small for his valour .,joy
now he took to the road boldly and as he was light and nimble he felt no fatigue .,joy
the road led him up a mountain and when he had reached the highest point of it there sat a powerful giant looking peacefully about him .,joy
"the little tailor went bravely up spoke to him and said : "" good day comrade so you are sitting there overlooking the wide spread world !",joy
i am just on my way thither and want to try my luck .,joy
"the giant looked contemptuously at the tailor and said : "" you ragamuffin !",anger
you miserable creature !,anger
"oh indeed ? "" answered the little tailor and unbuttoned his coat and showed the giant the girdle "" there may you read what kind of a man i am !",surprise
"the giant read : "" seven at one stroke "" and thought that they had been men whom the tailor had killed and began to feel a little respect for the tiny fellow .",surprise
"is that all ? "" said the tailor "" that is child "" s play with us ! "" and put his hand into his pocket brought out the soft cheese and pressed it until the liquid ran out of it .",joy
"faith "" said he "" that was a little better wasn "" t it ?",joy
the giant did not know what to say and could not believe it of the little man .,surprise
"now little mite of a man do that likewise "" "" well thrown "" said the tailor "" but after all the stone came down to earth again; i will throw you one which shall never come back at all "" and he put his hand into his pocket took out the bird and threw it into the air .",joy
the bird delighted with its liberty rose flew away and did not come back .,joy
"the giant took the trunk on his shoulder but the tailor seated himself on a branch and the giant who could not look round had to carry away the whole tree and the little tailor into the bargain : he behind was quite merry and happy and whistled the song : "" three tailors rode forth from the gate "" as if carrying the tree were child "" s play .",joy
"the giant after he had dragged the heavy burden part of the way could go no further and cried : "" hark you i shall have to let the tree fall !",sadness
"the tailor sprang nimbly down seized the tree with both arms as if he had been carrying it and said to the giant : "" you are such a great fellow and yet cannot even carry the tree !",joy
"when he had fallen down again without injury the giant said : "" what is this ?",surprise
have you not strength enough to hold the weak twig ?,surprise
when it was midnight and the giant thought that the little tailor was lying in a sound sleep he got up took a great iron bar cut through the bed with one blow and thought he had finished off the grasshopper for good .,joy
with the earliest dawn the giants went into the forest and had quite forgotten the little tailor when all at once he walked up to them quite merrily and boldly .,joy
"ah ! "" said they "" what does the great warrior want here in the midst of peace ?",surprise
they went and announced him to the king and gave it as their opinion that if war should break out this would be a weighty and useful man who ought on no account to be allowed to depart .,joy
the counsel pleased the king and he sent one of his courtiers to the little tailor to offer him military service when he awoke .,joy
the soldiers however were set against the little tailor and wished him a thousand miles away .,anger
"what is to be the end of this ? "" they said among themselves .",anger
they came therefore to a decision betook themselves in a body to the king and begged for their dismissal .,sadness
the king was sorry that for the sake of one he should lose all his faithful servants wished that he had never set eyes on the tailor and would willingly have been rid of him again .,anger
"that would indeed be a fine thing for a man like me ! "" thought the little tailor .",joy
"one is not offered a beautiful princess and half a kingdom every day of one "" s life !",joy
"for a long time the giant felt nothing but at last he awoke pushed his comrade and said : "" why are you knocking me ?",anger
"you must be dreaming "" said the other "" i am not knocking you .",surprise
"what is the meaning of this ? "" cried the other "" why are you pelting me ?",anger
"i am not pelting you "" answered the first growling .",anger
they disputed about it for a time but as they were weary they let the matter rest and their eyes closed once more .,anger
"that is too bad ! "" cried he and sprang up like a madman and pushed his companion against the tree until it shook .",anger
the other paid him back in the same coin and they got into such a rage that they tore up trees and belaboured each other so long that at last they both fell down dead on the ground at the same time .,anger
"it is a lucky thing "" said he "" that they did not tear up the tree on which i was sitting or i should have had to sprint on to another like a squirrel; but we tailors are nimble .",surprise
"but are you not wounded ? "" asked the horsemen .",surprise
"you need not concern yourself about that "" answered the tailor "" they have not bent one hair of mine .",joy
the horsemen would not believe him and rode into the forest; there they found the giants swimming in their blood and all round about lay the torn up trees .,surprise
"softly softly; it can "" t be done as quickly as that "" said he and stood still and waited until the animal was quite close and then sprang nimbly behind the tree .",joy
"now i have got the bird "" said the tailor and came out from behind the tree and put the rope round its neck and then with his axe he hewed the horn out of the tree and when all was ready he led the beast away and took it to the king .",joy
"willingly "" said the tailor "" that is child "" s play !",joy
when the boar perceived the tailor it ran on him with foaming mouth and whetted tusks and was about to throw him to the ground but the hero fled and sprang into a chapel which was near and up to the window at once and in one bound out again .,anger
the boar ran after him but the tailor ran round outside and shut the door behind it and then the raging beast which was much too heavy and awkward to leap out of the window was caught .,anger
the hero however went to the king who was now whether he liked it or not obliged to keep his promise and gave his daughter and the half of his kingdom .,sadness
the wedding was held with great magnificence and small joy and out of a tailor a king was made .,joy
"after some time the young queen heard her husband say in his dreams at night : "" boy make me the doublet and patch the pantaloons or else i will rap the yard measure over your ears .",anger
then she discovered in what state of life the young lord had been born and next morning complained of her wrongs to her father and begged him to help her to get rid of her husband who was nothing else but a tailor .,sadness
"the king comforted her and said : "" leave your bedroom door open this night and my servants shall stand outside and when he has fallen asleep shall go in bind him and take him on board a ship which shall carry him into the wide world .",joy
"the woman was satisfied with this; but the king "" s armour bearer who had heard all was friendly with the young lord and informed him of the whole plot .",joy
"i "" ll put a screw into that business "" said the little tailor .",anger
i killed two giants i brought away one unicorn and caught a wild boar and am i to fear those who are standing outside the room .,anger
this king once fell very ill so ill that nobody thought he could live .,sadness
"his sons were very much grieved at their father "" s sickness; and as they were walking together very mournfully in the garden of the palace a little old man met them and asked what was the matter .",sadness
they told him that their father was very ill and that they were afraid nothing could save him .,sadness
"i know what would "" said the little old man; "" it is the water of life .",joy
i had rather die than place you in such great danger as you must meet with in your journey .,anger
"but he begged so hard that the king let him go; and the prince thought to himself "" if i bring my father this water he will make me sole heir to his kingdom .",joy
"what is that to thee you ugly imp ? "" said the prince haughtily and rode on .",anger
but the dwarf was enraged at his behaviour and laid a fairy spell of ill luck upon him; so that as he rode on the mountain pass became narrower and narrower and at last the way was so straitened that he could not go to step forward : and when he thought to have turned his horse round and go back the way he came he heard a loud laugh ringing round him and found that the path was closed behind him so that he was shut in all round .,anger
he next tried to get off his horse and make his way on foot but again the laugh rang in his ears and he found himself unable to move a step and thus he was forced to abide spellbound .,surprise
"for he thought to himself "" my brother is surely dead and the kingdom will fall to me if i find the water .",joy
the king was at first very unwilling to let him go but at last yielded to his wish .,anger
"so he set out and followed the same road which his brother had done and met with the same elf who stopped him at the same spot in the mountains saying as before "" prince prince whither so fast ?",surprise
"mind your own affairs busybody ! "" said the prince scornfully and rode on .",anger
when the second prince had thus been gone a long time the youngest son said he would go and search for the water of life and trusted he should soon be able to make his father well again .,joy
"and the prince said "" i am going in search of the water of life because my father is ill and like to die : can you help me ?",surprise
pray tell me if you know .,joy
then as you have spoken to me kindly and are wise enough to seek for advice i will tell you how and where to go .,joy
"then the prince thanked his little friend with the scarlet cloak for his friendly aid and took the wand and the bread and went travelling on and on over sea and over land till he came to his journey "" s end and found everything to be as the dwarf had told him .",joy
further on he came to a room where a beautiful young lady sat upon a couch; and she welcomed him joyfully and said if he would set her free from the spell that bound her the kingdom should be his if he would come back in a year and marry her .,joy
just as he was going out of the iron door it struck twelve and the door fell so quickly upon him that it snapped off a piece of his heel .,surprise
"when he found himself safe he was overjoyed to think that he had got the water of life; and as he was going on his way homewards he passed by the little dwarf who when he saw the sword and the loaf said "" you have made a noble prize; with the sword you can at a blow slay whole armies and the bread will never fail you .",surprise
"then the prince thought to himself "" i cannot go home to my father without my brothers "" ; so he said "" my dear friend cannot you tell me where my two brothers are who set out in search of the water of life before me and never came back ?",sadness
"i have shut them up by a charm between two mountains "" said the dwarf "" because they were proud and ill behaved and scorned to ask advice .",anger
"the prince begged so hard for his brothers that the dwarf at last set them free though unwillingly saying "" beware of them for they have bad hearts .",anger
their brother however was greatly rejoiced to see them and told them all that had happened to him; how he had found the water of life and had taken a cup full of it; and how he had set a beautiful princess free from a spell that bound her; and how she had engaged to wait a whole year and then to marry him and to give him the kingdom .,joy
then they all three rode on together and on their way home came to a country that was laid waste by war and a dreadful famine so that it was feared all must die for want .,surprise
but the prince gave the king of the land the bread and all his kingdom ate of it .,joy
"and he lent the king the wonderful sword and he slew the enemy "" s army with it; and thus the kingdom was once more in peace and plenty .",joy
"when they came to the sea they got into a ship and during their voyage the two eldest said to themselves "" our brother has got the water which we could not find therefore our father will forsake us and give him the kingdom which is our right "" ; so they were full of envy and revenge and agreed together how they could ruin him .",anger
then they waited till he was fast asleep and poured the water of life out of the cup and took it for themselves giving him bitter sea water instead .,surprise
scarcely however had he tasted the bitter sea water when he became worse even than he was before; and then both the elder sons came in and blamed the youngest for what they had done; and said that he wanted to poison their father but that they had found the water of life and had brought it with them .,surprise
he no sooner began to drink of what they brought him than he felt his sickness leave him and was as strong and well as in his younger days .,joy
"then they went to their brother and laughed at him and said "" well brother you found the water of life did you ?",surprise
you have had the trouble and we shall have the reward .,joy
pray with all your cleverness why did not you manage to keep your eyes open ?,joy
next year one of us will take away your beautiful princess if you do not take care .,anger
you had better say nothing about this to our father for he does not believe a word you say; and if you tell tales you shall lose your life into the bargain : but be quiet and we will let you off .,anger
the old king was still very angry with his youngest son and thought that he really meant to have taken away his life; so he called his court together and asked what should be done and all agreed that he ought to be put to death .,anger
"the prince knew nothing of what was going on till one day when the king "" s chief huntsmen went a hunting with him and they were alone in the wood together the huntsman looked so sorrowful that the prince said "" my friend what is the matter with you ?",sadness
"i cannot and dare not tell you "" said he .",sadness
"alas ! "" said the huntsman; "" the king has ordered me to shoot you .",sadness
"the prince started at this and said "" let me live and i will change dresses with you; you shall take my royal coat to show to my father and do you give me your shabby one .",surprise
"with all my heart "" said the huntsman; "" i am sure i shall be glad to save you for i could not have shot you .",joy
"this touched the old king "" s heart and he thought his son might still be guiltless and said to his court "" o that my son were still alive ! how it grieves me that i had him killed !",anger
"he is still alive "" said the huntsman; "" and i am glad that i had pity on him but let him go in peace and brought home his royal coat .",joy
at this the king was overwhelmed with joy and made it known thoughout all his kingdom that if his son would come back to his court he would forgive him .,joy
meanwhile the princess was eagerly waiting till her deliverer should come back; and had a road made leading up to her palace all of shining gold; and told her courtiers that whoever came on horseback and rode straight up to the gate upon it was her true lover; and that they must let him in : but whoever rode on one side of it they must be sure was not the right one; and that they must send him away at once .,joy
"as he came before the palace and saw the golden road he stopped to look at it and he thought to himself "" it is a pity to ride upon this beautiful road "" ; so he turned aside and rode on the right hand side of it .",surprise
"the second prince set out soon afterwards on the same errand; and when he came to the golden road and his horse had set one foot upon it he stopped to look at it and thought it very beautiful and said to himself "" what a pity it is that anything should tread here !",surprise
so he journeyed on thinking of her all the way and rode so quickly that he did not even see what the road was made of but went with his horse straight over it; and as he came to the gate it flew open and the princess welcomed him with joy and said he was her deliverer and should now be her husband and lord of the kingdom .,joy
when the first joy at their meeting was over the princess told him she had heard of his father having forgiven him and of his wish to have him home again : so before his wedding with the princess he went to visit his father taking her with him .,joy
then he told him everything; how his brothers had cheated and robbed him and yet that he had borne all those wrongs for the love of his father .,joy
and the old king was very angry and wanted to punish his wicked sons; but they made their escape and got into a ship and sailed away over the wide sea and where they went to nobody knew and nobody cared .,anger
and now the old king gathered together his court and asked all his kingdom to come and celebrate the wedding of his son and the princess .,joy
and young and old noble and squire gentle and simple came at once on the summons; and among the rest came the friendly dwarf with the sugarloaf hat and a new scarlet cloak .,joy
and the wedding was held and the merry bells run .,joy
"and all the good people they danced and they sung and feasted and frolick "" d i can "" t tell how long .",joy
this had gone on for a long time when one day the servant who took away the dish was overcome with such curiosity that he could not help carrying the dish into his room .,surprise
but when he saw it he could not deny himself the pleasure of tasting it so he cut of a little bit and put it into his mouth .,joy
the king ordered the man to be brought before him and threatened with angry words that unless he could before the morrow point out the thief he himself should be looked upon as guilty and executed .,anger
now some ducks were sitting together quietly by a brook and taking their rest; and whilst they were making their feathers smooth with their bills they were having a confidential conversation together .,joy
"they were telling one another of all the places where they had been waddling about all the morning and what good food they had found; and one said in a pitiful tone : "" something lies heavy on my stomach; as i was eating in haste i swallowed a ring which lay under the queen "" s window .",sadness
the servant could now easily prove his innocence; and the king to make amends for the wrong allowed him to ask a favour and promised him the best place in the court that he could wish for .,joy
when his request was granted he set out on his way and one day came to a pond where he saw three fishes caught in the reeds and gasping for water .,sadness
"they leapt with delight put out their heads and cried to him : "" we will remember you and repay you for saving us !",joy
"he listened and heard an ant king complain : "" why cannot folks with their clumsy beasts keep off our bodies ?",anger
that stupid horse with his heavy hoofs has been treading down my people without mercy !,anger
"so he turned on to a side path and the ant king cried out to him : "" we will remember you one good turn deserves another !",joy
"out with you you idle good for nothing creatures ! "" cried they; "" we cannot find food for you any longer; you are big enough and can provide for yourselves .",anger
"then they came hopping up to it satisfied their hunger and cried : "" we will remember you one good turn deserves another !",joy
"many had already made the attempt but in vain; nevertheless when the youth saw the king "" s daughter he was so overcome by her great beauty that he forgot all danger went before the king and declared himself a suitor .",joy
all the people grieved for the handsome youth; then they went away leaving him alone by the sea .,sadness
he stood on the shore and considered what he should do when suddenly he saw three fishes come swimming towards him and they were the very fishes whose lives he had saved .,surprise
full of joy he took it to the king and expected that he would grant him the promised reward .,joy
but when the proud princess perceived that he was not her equal in birth she scorned him and required him first to perform another task .,anger
the youth sat down in the garden and considered how it might be possible to perform this task but he could think of nothing and there he sat sorrowfully awaiting the break of day when he should be led to death .,sadness
the ant king had come in the night with thousands and thousands of ants and the grateful creatures had by great industry picked up all the millet seed and gathered them into the sacks .,joy
"presently the king "" s daughter herself came down into the garden and was amazed to see that the young man had done the task she had given him .",surprise
"the youth full of joy set out homewards and took the golden apple to the king "" s beautiful daughter who had now no more excuses left to make .",joy
they cut the apple of life in two and ate it together; and then her heart became full of love for him and they lived in undisturbed happiness to a great age .,joy
"the bear would have liked to go at once but the wolf held him back by the sleeve and said : "" no you must wait until the lord and lady queen have gone away again .",anger
the bear however could not rest until he had seen the royal palace and when a short time had passed went to it again .,anger
"is that the royal palace ? "" cried the bear; "" it is a wretched palace and you are not king "" s children you are disreputable children !",anger
"when the young wrens heard that they were frightfully angry and screamed : "" no that we are not !",anger
our parents are honest people !,anger
bear you will have to pay for that !,anger
"the young willow wrens however continued to cry and scream and when their parents again brought food they said : "" we will not so much as touch one fly "" s leg no not if we were dying of hunger until you have settled whether we are respectable children or not; the bear has been here and has insulted us !",anger
"then the old king said : "" be easy he shall be punished "" and he at once flew with the queen to the bear "" s cave and called in : "" old growler why have you insulted my children ?",anger
you shall suffer for it we will punish you by a bloody war .,anger
when the gnat had heard that she flew away again and revealed everything down to the minutest detail to the willow wren .,surprise
when the fox felt the first string he started so that he one leg from pain but he bore it and still kept his tail high in the air; at the second sting he was forced to put it down for a moment; at the third he could hold out no longer screamed and put his tail between his legs .,anger
when the animals saw that they thought all was lost and began to flee each into his hole and the birds had won the battle .,surprise
"then the king and queen flew home to their children and cried : "" children rejoice eat and drink to your heart "" s content we have won the battle !",joy
"but the young wrens said : "" we will not eat yet the bear must come to the nest and beg for pardon and say that we are honourable children before we will do that .",anger
"then the willow wren flew to the bear "" s hole and cried : "" growler you are to come to the nest to my children and beg their pardon or else every rib of your body shall be broken .",anger
and now at last the young wrens were satisfied and sat down together and ate and drank and made merry till quite late into the night .,joy
there was once upon a time an old goat who had seven little kids and loved them with all the love of a mother for her children .,joy
then the old one bleated and went on her way with an easy mind .,joy
she has a soft pleasant voice but your voice is rough; you are the wolf !,anger
"the miller thought to himself : "" the wolf wants to deceive someone "" and refused; but the wolf said : "" if you will not do it i will devour you .",anger
then he put his paws in through the window and when the kids saw that they were white they believed that all he said was true and opened the door .,joy
but who should come in but the wolf !,surprise
but the wolf found them all and used no great ceremony; one after the other he swallowed them down his throat .,sadness
when the wolf had satisfied his appetite he took himself off laid himself down under a tree in the green meadow outside and began to sleep .,joy
ah ! what a sight she saw there !,surprise
then you may imagine how she wept over her poor children .,sadness
at length in her grief she went out and the youngest kid ran with her .,sadness
"ah heavens "" she said "" is it possible that my poor children whom he has swallowed down for his supper can be still alive ?",surprise
"then the kid had to run home and fetch scissors and a needle and thread and the goat cut open the monster "" s stomach and hardly had she made one cut than one little kid thrust its head out and when she had cut farther all six sprang out one after another and were all still alive and had suffered no injury whatever for in his greediness the monster had swallowed them down whole .",surprise
what rejoicing there was !,joy
they embraced their dear mother and jumped like a tailor at his wedding .,joy
"the mother however said : "" now go and look for some big stones and we will fill the wicked beast "" s stomach with them while he is still asleep .",anger
and when he got to the well and stooped over the water to drink the heavy stones made him fall in and he drowned miserably .,sadness
"when the seven kids saw that they came running to the spot and cried aloud : "" the wolf is dead !",joy
"the wolf is dead ! "" and danced for joy round about the well with their mother .",joy
"how lonely it is wife "" said he as he puffed out a long curl of smoke "" for you and me to sit here by ourselves without any children to play about and amuse us while other people seem so happy and merry with their children !",sadness
"what you say is very true "" said the wife sighing and turning round her wheel; "" how happy should i be if i had but one child !",sadness
if it were ever so small nay if it were no bigger than my thumb i should be very happy and love it dearly .,sadness
"now odd as you may think it it came to pass that this good woman "" s wish was fulfilled just in the very way she had wished it; for not long afterwards she had a little boy who was quite healthy and strong but was not much bigger than my thumb .",surprise
"so they said "" well we cannot say we have not got what we wished for and little as he is we will love him dearly .",joy
they gave him plenty of food yet for all they could do he never grew bigger but kept just the same size as he had been when he was born .,surprise
still his eyes were sharp and sparkling and he soon showed himself to be a clever little fellow who always knew well what he was about .,joy
"one day as the woodman was getting ready to go into the wood to cut fuel he said "" i wish i had someone to bring the cart after me for i want to make haste .",anger
"oh father "" cried tom "" i will take care of that; the cart shall be in the wood by the time you want it .",surprise
"then the woodman laughed and said "" how can that be ? you cannot reach up to the horse "" s bridle .",joy
"never mind that father "" said tom; "" if my mother will only harness the horse i will get into his ear and tell him which way to go .",joy
"when the time came the mother harnessed the horse to the cart and put tom into his ear; and as he sat there the little man told the beast how to go crying out "" go on ! "" and "" stop ! "" as he wanted : and thus the horse went on just as well as if the woodman had driven it himself into the wood .",surprise
"what an odd thing that is ! "" said one : "" there is a cart going along and i hear a carter talking to the horse but yet i can see no one .",surprise
"that is queer indeed "" said the other; "" let us follow the cart and see where it goes .",surprise
"then tom thumb seeing his father cried out "" see father here i am with the cart all right and safe ! now take me down !",joy
"so his father took hold of the horse with one hand and with the other took his son out of the horse "" s ear and put him down upon a straw where he sat as merry as you please .",joy
the two strangers were all this time looking on and did not know what to say for wonder .,surprise
"at last one took the other aside and said "" that little urchin will make our fortune if we can get him and carry him about from town to town as a show; we must buy him .",surprise
"i won "" t sell him at all "" said the father; "" my own flesh and blood is dearer to me than all the silver and gold in the world .",anger
"but tom hearing of the bargain they wanted to make crept up his father "" s coat to his shoulder and whispered in his ear "" take the money father and let them have me; i "" ll soon come back to you .",joy
oh put me on the rim of your hat; that will be a nice gallery for me; i can walk about there and see the country as we go along .,joy
so they did as he wished; and when tom had taken leave of his father they took him away with them .,sadness
"good night my masters ! "" said he "" i "" m off ! mind and look sharp after me the next time .",joy
then they ran at once to the place and poked the ends of their sticks into the mouse hole but all in vain; tom only crawled farther and farther in; and at last it became quite dark so that they were forced to go their way without their prize as sulky as could be .,anger
"what dangerous walking it is "" said he "" in this ploughed field !",surprise
at last by good luck he found a large empty snail shell .,surprise
"this is lucky "" said he "" i can sleep here very well "" ; and in he crept .",joy
"i "" ll tell you ! "" cried tom .",joy
"but where are you ? "" said they .",surprise
at last the thieves found him out and lifted him up in their hands .,surprise
"you little urchin ! "" they said "" what can you do for us ?",surprise
"why i can get between the iron window bars of the parson "" s house and throw you out whatever you want .",joy
"that "" s a good thought "" said the thieves; "" come along we shall see what you can do .",surprise
"so they came back and whispered softly to him saying "" now let us have no more of your roguish jokes; but throw us out some of the money .",anger
the cook heard this quite plain so she sprang out of bed and ran to open the door .,anger
by the time she came back tom had slipped off into the barn; and when she had looked about and searched every hole and corner and found nobody she went to bed thinking she must have been dreaming with her eyes open .,surprise
the cook got up early before daybreak to feed the cows; and going straight to the hay loft carried away a large bundle of hay with the little man in the middle of it fast asleep .,surprise
"he still however slept on and did not awake till he found himself in the mouth of the cow; for the cook had put the hay into the cow "" s rick and the cow had taken tom up in a mouthful of it .",surprise
"good lack a day ! "" said he "" how came i to tumble into the mill ?",surprise
though he made the best of his bad luck he did not like his quarters at all; and the worst of it was that more and more hay was always coming down and the space left for him became smaller and smaller .,surprise
"but the parson said "" woman thou art surely mad !",anger
tom soon set himself to work to get out which was not a very easy task; but at last just as he had made room to get his head out fresh ill luck befell him .,surprise
a hungry wolf sprang out and swallowed up the whole stomach with tom in it at one gulp and ran away .,surprise
"tom however was still not disheartened; and thinking the wolf would not dislike having some chat with him as he was going along he called out "" my good friend i can show you a famous treat .",joy
"where "" s that ? "" said the wolf .",surprise
"the wolf did not want to be asked twice; so that very night he went to the house and crawled through the drain into the kitchen and then into the pantry and ate and drank there to his heart "" s content .",joy
this was just what tom had reckoned upon; and now he began to set up a great shout making all the noise he could .,joy
"what "" s that to me ? "" said the little man; "" you have had your frolic now i "" ve a mind to be merry myself "" ; and he began singing and shouting as loud as he could .",joy
"tom heard all this and cried out "" father father !",joy
"and his father said "" heaven be praised ! we have found our dear child again "" ; and he told his wife not to use the scythe for fear she should hurt him .",joy
then he aimed a great blow and struck the wolf on the head and killed him on the spot ! and when he was dead they cut open his body and set tommy free .,joy
"ah ! "" said the father "" what fears we have had for you !",joy
"yes father "" answered he; "" i have travelled all over the world i think in one way or other since we parted; and now i am very glad to come home and get fresh air again .",joy
"why where have you been ? "" said his father .",surprise
"i have been in a mouse hole and in a snail shell and down a cow "" s throat and in the wolf "" s belly; and yet here i am again safe and sound .",joy
"well "" said they "" you are come back and we will not sell you again for all the riches in the world .",joy
then they hugged and kissed their dear little son and gave him plenty to eat and drink for he was very hungry; and then they fetched new clothes for him for his old ones had been quite spoiled on his journey .,joy
"so master thumb stayed at home with his father and mother in peace; for though he had been so great a traveller and had done and seen so many fine things and was fond enough of telling the whole story he always agreed that after all there "" s no place like home !",joy

Then their anxieties are dispelled; and at even they join in the dance at the feast given in the great hall at Borglum.,joy
"An old maid stood at the window; she had hung chickweed over the cage, and the little linnet which it contained hopped from perch to perch and sang and twittered merrily.",joy
"""Yes, it's all very well for you to sing,"" said the bottle neck: that is, he did not really speak the words as we do, for the neck of a bottle cannot speak; but he thought them to himself in his own mind, just as people sometimes talk quietly to themselves.",joy
"""Yes, you may sing very well, you have all your limbs uninjured; you should feel what it is like to lose your body, and only have a neck and a mouth left, with a cork stuck in it, as I have: you wouldn't sing then, I know.",anger
"I have no reason to sing, nor could I sing now if I were ever so happy; but when I was a whole bottle, and they rubbed me with a cork, didn't I sing then?",sadness
"The little bird sang his own song merrily; in the street below there was driving and running to and fro, every one thought of his own affairs, or perhaps of nothing at all; but the bottle neck thought deeply.",joy
"The bottle did not behold the light of day again, until it was unpacked with the rest in the wine merchant's cellar, and, for the first time, rinsed with water, which caused some very curious sensations.",surprise
"""Ah, how beautiful is life.""",joy
"All these tones of joy and song in the bottle were like the working of a young poet's brain, who often knows not the meaning of the tones which are sounding within him.",joy
"She was young and pretty; her brown eyes laughed, and a smile lingered round her mouth as sweet as that in her eyes.",joy
"There had been a great deal of talk on this subject while the basket was being packed, and during this conversation the eyes and the mouth of the furrier's daughter did not wear a very joyful expression.",sadness
"It remained there a long time; but when at last it was brought forth it appeared as if something pleasant had happened, for every one was laughing; the furrier's daughter laughed too, but she said very little, and her cheeks were like two roses.",joy
What a strange sensation it was to have the cork drawn for the first time!,surprise
"""Long life to the betrothed,"" cried the papa, and every glass was emptied to the dregs, while the young sailor kissed his beautiful bride.",joy
"""Happiness and blessing to you both,"" said the old people-father and mother, and the young man filled the glasses again.",joy
"""Safe return, and a wedding this day next year,"" he cried; and when the glasses were empty he took the bottle, raised it on high, and said, ""Thou hast been present here on the happiest day of my life; thou shalt never be used by others!""",joy
"""I gave them wine, and they gave me muddy water,"" he had said to himself, ""but I suppose it was all well meant.""",anger
"He could no longer see the betrothed couple, nor the cheerful old people; but for a long time he could hear them rejoicing and singing.",joy

"""What trouble they have taken with that bottle over yonder!"" said one, and very likely it is broken after all.""",surprise
"But the bottle was not broken, and, better still, it understood every word that was said: this language it had heard at the furnaces and at the wine merchant's; in the forest and on the ship,- it was the only good old language it could understand.",surprise
"It had returned home, and the language was as a welcome greeting.",joy
"For very joy, it felt ready to jump out of people's hands, and scarcely noticed that its cork had been drawn, and its contents emptied out, till it found itself carried to a cellar, to be left there and forgotten.",joy
"""There's no place like home, even if it's a cellar.""",joy
"It never occurred to him to think that he might lie there for years, he felt so comfortable.",joy
"The stars twinkled; and the new moon, in the form of a crescent, was surrounded by the shadowy disc of the whole moon, and looked like a gray globe with a golden rim: it was a beautiful sight for those who had good eyes.",joy
"Everything here appeared lovely to our bottle, for it was again in the green wood, amid joy and feasting; again it heard music and song, and the noise and murmur of a crowd, especially in that part of the garden where the lamps blazed, and the paper lanterns displayed their brilliant colors.",joy
"It stood in a distant walk certainly, but a place pleasant for contemplation; and it carried a light; and was at once useful and ornamental.",joy
It seemed to the bottle as if he were living that time over again.,joy
"Not only the guests but other people were walking in the garden, who were allowed to witness the splendor and the festivities.",joy
"She was thinking, like the bottle, of the green wood, and of a young betrothed pair, who were closely connected with herself; she was thinking of that hour, the happiest of her life, in which she had taken part, when she had herself been one of that betrothed pair; such hours are never to be forgotten, let a maiden be as old as she may.",joy
"The rabbit was quite excited because he knew that he was to be taken up, and let down again in a parachute.",joy
"Then the ropes which held it were cut through, and the aerial ship rose in the air with the aeronaut and the basket containing the bottle and the rabbit, while the music sounded and all the people shouted ""Hurrah.""",joy
"""This is a wonderful journey up into the air,"" thought the bottle; ""it is a new way of sailing, and here, at least, there is no fear of striking against anything.""",joy
"Then it began to descend much more rapidly than the rabbit had done, made somersaults in the air, and felt itself quite young and unfettered, although it was half full of wine.",surprise
"Then they hung it in the cage of the little bird, who sang and twittered more merrily than ever.",joy
Do you see how splendidly the tree has grown?,joy
"It has been raised from only a little sprig of myrtle that you gave me on the day after my betrothal, and from which I was to make my own bridal bouquet when a year had passed: but that day never came; the eyes were closed which were to have been my light and joy through life.",sadness
"Before the sprig you gave me faded, I took a spray, and planted it in the earth; and now, as you see, it has become a large tree, and a bunch of the blossoms shall at last appear at a wedding festival, in the bouquet of your daughter.""",joy
"There were tears in the eyes of the old maid, as she spoke of the beloved of her youth, and of their betrothal in the wood.",joy
"Corn grows in the surrounding fields, not only rye and barley, but oats,-pretty oats that, when ripe, look like a number of little golden canary-birds sitting on a bough.",joy
The corn has a smiling look and the heaviest and richest ears bend their heads low as if in pious humility.,joy
"The buckwheat did not bend like the other grain, but erected its head proudly and stiffly on the stem.",joy
"""I am as valuable as any other corn,"" said he, ""and I am much handsomer; my flowers are as beautiful as the bloom of the apple blossom, and it is a pleasure to look at us.",joy
"Do you know of anything prettier than we are, you old willow-tree?""",joy
"And the willow-tree nodded his head, as if he would say, ""Indeed I do.""",surprise
"But the buckwheat spread itself out with pride, and said, ""Stupid tree; he is so old that grass grows out of his body.""",anger
"""I have no occasion to do so,"" replied the buckwheat.",anger
"""But I will not bend my head,"" said the buckwheat.",anger
"""Inferior, indeed!"" said the buckwheat.",anger
"""Now I intend to have a peep into heaven.""",anger
"Proudly and boldly he looked up, while the lightning flashed across the sky as if the whole world were in flames.",joy
"When the dreadful storm had passed, the flowers and the corn raised their drooping heads in the pure still air, refreshed by the rain, but the buckwheat lay like a weed in the field, burnt to blackness by the lightning.",sadness
"The branches of the old willow-tree rustled in the wind, and large water-drops fell from his green leaves as if the old willow were weeping.",sadness
"Then the sparrows asked why he was weeping, when all around him seemed so cheerful.",surprise
"""See,"" they said, how the sun shines, and the clouds float in the blue sky.",joy
Do you not smell the sweet perfume from flower and bush?,surprise
"Wherefore do you weep, old willow-tree?""",surprise
"Then the willow told them of the haughty pride of the buckwheat, and of the punishment which followed in consequence.",sadness
"THERE was once a butterfly who wished for a bride, and, as may be supposed, he wanted to choose a very pretty one from among the flowers.",joy
"He glanced, with a very critical eye, at all the flower-beds, and found that the flowers were seated quietly and demurely on their stalks, just as maidens should sit before they are engaged; but there was a great number of them, and it appeared as if his search would become very wearisome.",anger
"The butterfly came also to Marguerite to inquire, but he did not pluck off her leaves; he pressed a kiss on each of them, for he thought there was always more to be done by kindness.",joy
But Marguerite did not answer him; she was offended that he should call her a woman when she was only a girl; and there is a great difference.,anger
"Then he would wait no longer, but flew away, to commence his wooing at once.",anger
"""They are very pretty,"" thought the butterfly; ""charming little lasses; but they are rather formal.""",joy
He next flew to the anemones; these were rather sour to his taste.,anger
"The violet, a little too sentimental.",sadness
"The pea-blossom pleased him most of all; she was white and red, graceful and slender, and belonged to those domestic maidens who have a pretty appearance, and can yet be useful in the kitchen.",joy
"He was just about to make her an offer, when, close by the maiden, he saw a pod, with a withered flower hanging at the end.",surprise
"""Oh, indeed; and you will be like her some day,"" said he; and he flew away directly, for he felt quite shocked.",surprise
No; he did not like her.,anger
"You know, this plant has no blossom; but it is sweetness all over,- full of fragrance from head to foot, with the scent of a flower in every leaf.",joy
"""I will take her,"" said the butterfly; and he made her an offer.",joy
"I am old, and you are old, but we may live for each other just the same; as to marrying- no; don't let us appear ridiculous at our age.""",anger
"He could exist here, he said, well enough.",joy
"""But it is not enough merely to exist,"" said he, ""I need freedom, sunshine, and a little flower for a companion.""",sadness
"Then he flew against the window-pane, and was seen and admired by those in the room, who caught him, and stuck him on a pin, in a box of curiosities.",joy
"""It is not very pleasant, certainly; I should imagine it is something like being married; for here I am stuck fast.""",sadness
And with this thought he consoled himself a little.,sadness
"""That seems very poor consolation,"" said one of the plants in the room, that grew in a pot.",sadness
"""Ah,"" thought the butterfly, ""one can't very well trust these plants in pots; they have too much to do with mankind.""",anger
"Well, perhaps, if in the beginning of a book these were written and printed, many, when they read it, would lay the book down and say, ""It seems to me a very miserable title, I don't like things of this sort.""",sadness
"So I have inherited from him, not only my good temper, but a habit of going often to the churchyard, which is good, when done in a proper humor; and then also I take in the Intelligencer, just as he used to do.",joy
"I am not very young, I have neither wife nor children, nor a library, but, as I said, I read the Intelligencer, which is enough for me; it is to me a delightful paper, and so it was to my father.",joy
"And then what a number of subscriptions to charities, and what innocent verses!",surprise
The newspaper and the churchyard were always exciting objects to me.,joy
"Here, behind the white iron railings, once a rose-tree grew; it is gone now, but a little bit of evergreen, from a neighboring grave, stretches out its green tendrils, and makes some appearance; there rests a very unhappy man, and yet while he lived he might be said to occupy a very good position.",sadness
"He had enough to live upon, and something to spare; but owing to his refined tastes the least thing in the world annoyed him.",anger
"If he went to a theatre of an evening, instead of enjoying himself he would be quite annoyed if the machinist had put too strong a light into one side of the moon, or if the representations of the sky hung over the scenes when they ought to have hung behind them; or if a palm-tree was introduced into a scene representing the Zoological Gardens of Berlin, or a cactus in a view of Tyrol, or a beech-tree in the north of Norway.",anger
As if these things were of any consequence!,surprise
Why did he not leave them alone?,surprise
"Who would trouble themselves about such trifles? especially at a comedy, where every one is expected to be amused.",surprise
"""They are like wet wood,"" he would say, looking round to see what sort of people were present, ""this evening; nothing fires them.""",anger
"Then he would vex and fret himself because they did not laugh at the right time, or because they laughed in the wrong places; and so he fretted and worried himself till at last the unhappy man fretted himself into the grave.",anger
It is beautiful to observe how wisely nature orders these things.,joy
"Here rests,- ah, it makes one feel mournful to think of him!- but here rests a man who, during sixty-seven years, was never remembered to have said a good thing; he lived only in the hope of having a good idea.",surprise
"At last he felt convinced, in his own mind, that he really had one, and was so delighted that he positively died of joy at the thought of having at last caught an idea.",joy
What a miser she was!,anger
"I come here often, and if any of my friends, or those who are not my friends, are too much for me, I go out and choose a plot of ground in which to bury him or her.",surprise
"Then I bury them, as it were; there they lie, dead and powerless, till they come back new and better characters.",surprise
"Then, if any of our friends act absurdly, no one need to be vexed about it.",surprise
"Let them bury the offenders out of sight, and keep their good temper.",joy
"""The man with a cheerful temper.""",joy
"The sisters mourned as young hearts can mourn, and were especially grieved at the sight of their parents' sorrow.",sadness
"The father's heart was bowed down, but the mother sunk completely under the deep grief.",sadness
"She thought God could not take her darling little one from her; and when it did happen notwithstanding her hopes and her belief, and there could be no more doubt on the subject, she said in her feverish agony, ""God does not know it.",sadness
"Thus in her great grief she fell away from her faith in God, and dark thoughts arose in her mind respecting death and a future state.",sadness
"But these doubts were no support to her, nothing on which she could rest, and she sunk into the fathomless depths of despair.",sadness
"In her darkest hours she ceased to weep, and thought not of the young daughters who were still left to her.",sadness
"The tears of her husband fell on her forehead, but she took no notice of him; her thoughts were with her dead child; her whole existence seemed wrapped up in the remembrances of the little one and of every innocent word it had uttered.",sadness
"When she awoke, and wanted to see her child, the husband, with tears, said, ""We have closed the coffin; it was necessary to do so.""",sadness
"""When God is so hard to me, how can I expect men to be better?"" she said with groans and tears.",sadness
"She gave herself up to her grief, and it tossed her to and fro, as the sea tosses a ship without compass or rudder.",sadness
"With tearful eyes and mournful glances, the sorrowing daughters and the afflicted husband looked upon her who would not hear their words of comfort; and, indeed, what comforting words could they speak, when they were themselves so full of grief?",sadness
"As she had sat by his little cot, so now she sat by his grave; and here she could weep freely, and her tears fell upon it.",sadness
"""Down to my child,"" she repeated; and tones of despair and entreaty sounded in the words.",sadness
"Then the cloak was removed, and she found herself in a large hall, of wide-spreading dimensions, in which there was a subdued light, like twilight, reigning, and in a moment her child appeared before her, smiling, and more beautiful than ever; with a silent cry she pressed him to her heart.",surprise
Never had she listened to such tones as these; they came from beyond a large dark curtain which separated the regions of death from the land of eternity.,surprise
"""My sweet, darling mother,"" she heard the child say.",joy
"It was the well-known, beloved voice; and kiss followed kiss, in boundless delight.",joy
"""There is nothing so beautiful on earth as it is here.",joy
"Oh, it is happiness indeed.""",joy
"""I can fly now, mother,"" said the child; ""I can fly with other happy children into the presence of the Almighty.",joy
"""Oh, stay, stay!"" implored the mother; ""only one moment more; only once more, that I may look upon thee, and kiss thee, and press thee to my heart.""",sadness
"No; their sighs and lamentations still sounded from above; and she had nearly forgotten them, for the sake of him who was dead.",sadness
"And when she had offered this prayer, her heart felt lighter.",joy
"Everything around her seemed holy, and her heart was chastened.",joy
"She bent over her husband, who still slept; her warm, devoted kiss awakened him, and words of heartfelt love fell from the lips of both.",joy
"Now she was gentle and strong as a wife can be; and from her lips came the words of faith: ""Whatever He doeth is right and best.""",joy
"Then her husband asked, ""From whence hast thou all at once derived such strength and comforting faith?""",surprise
"And as she kissed him and her children, she said, ""It came from God, through my child in the grave.""",joy
"""Not all can be born cucumbers; there must be other things, too.",anger

"The latter has neither hens nor chicks, and only thinks of himself and perspires verdigris.",anger
"No, the yard cock is really a cock!",surprise
His step is a dance!,joy
"His crowing is music, and wherever he goes one knows what a trumpeter is like!",joy
If he would only come in here!,sadness
"Even if he ate me up stump, stalk, and all, and I had to dissolve in his body, it would be a happy death,"" said the cucumber.",joy
"He had been born old, and did not at all resemble the birds flying in the air- the sparrows, and the swallows; no, he despised them, these mean little piping birds, these common whistlers.",anger
"He admitted that the pigeons, large and white and shining like mother-o'-pearl, looked like a kind of weather-cock; but they were fat and stupid, and all their thoughts and endeavours were directed to filling themselves with food, and besides, they were tiresome things to converse with.",anger
"All this was new and interesting; that is, for the first time, but afterwards, as the weather-cock found out, they repeated themselves and always told the same stories, and that's very tedious, and there was no one with whom one could associate, for one and all were stale and small-minded.",anger
"""The world is no good!"" he said.",anger
"""Everything in it is so stupid.""",anger
"The weather-cock was puffed up, and that quality would have made him interesting in the eyes of the cucumber if it had known it, but it had eyes only for the yard cock, who was now in the yard with it.",anger
"The wind had blown the planks, but the storm was over.",sadness
"""What do you think of that crowing?"" said the yard cock to the hens and chickens.",anger
"""It was a little rough- it wanted elegance.""",anger
"And the hens and chickens came up on the dung-hill, and the cock strutted about like a lord.",joy
"""Garden plant!"" he said to the cucumber, and in that one word his deep learning showed itself, and it forgot that he was pecking at her and eating it up.",surprise
"""A happy death!""",joy
"The hens and the chickens came, for where one runs the others run too; they clucked, and chirped, and looked at the cock, and were proud that he was of their kind.",joy
"""Cock-a-doodle-doo!"" he crowed, ""the chickens will grow up into great hens at once, if I cry it out in the poultry-yard of the world!""",joy

"With that the yard cock flapped his wings, made his comb swell up, and crowed again; and they all shuddered, the hens and the little chicks- but they were very proud that one of their number was such a champion of all cocks.",joy
They clucked and chirped till the weather-cock heard; he heard it; but he did not stir.,joy

"The little daisy was as happy as if the day had been a great holiday, but it was only Monday.",joy
"All the children were at school, and while they were sitting on the forms and learning their lessons, it sat on its thin green stalk and learnt from the sun and from its surroundings how kind God is, and it rejoiced that the song of the little lark expressed so sweetly and distinctly its own feelings.",joy

How happy the daisy was!,joy
"Half ashamed, yet glad at heart, it looked over to the other flowers in the garden; surely they had witnessed its pleasure and the honour that had been done to it; they understood its joy.",joy

"""Ugh!"" sighed the daisy, ""that is terrible; now they are done for.""",surprise

"And Holger Danske did dream of the little humble room in which the image-carver sat; he heard all that had been said, and he nodded in his dream, saying, ""Ah, yes, remember me, you Danish people, keep me in your memory, I will come to you in the hour of need.""",joy
"But one day Ib succeeded so well in his carving that he made two pieces of wood look really like two little wooden shoes, and he determined to give them as a present to Little Christina.",surprise
"Ib and Christina agreed together in everything; they divided their bread and berries when they were hungry; they were partners in digging their little gardens; they ran, and crept, and played about everywhere.",joy
"They floated on swiftly, for the tide was in their favor, passing over lakes, formed by the stream in its course; sometimes they seemed quite enclosed by reeds and water-plants, yet there was always room for them to pass out, although the old trees overhung the water and the old oaks stretched out their bare branches, as if they had turned up their sleeves and wished to show their knotty, naked arms.",joy
"The water-lilies waved themselves to and fro on the river, everything made the excursion beautiful, and at last they came to the great eel-weir, where the water rushed through the flood-gates; and the children thought this a beautiful sight.",joy
"First they peeped into the basket containing the eels and the sucking-pig; then they must needs pull out the pig and take it in their hands, and feel it, and touch it; and as they both wanted to hold it at the same time, the consequence was that they let it fall into the water, and the pig sailed away with the stream.",surprise
Here was a terrible disaster.,surprise
"In a few minutes they found themselves deep in a thicket, and could no longer see the boat or the shore.",surprise
"They ran on a little farther, and then Christina fell down, and began to cry.",sadness
"They looked so inviting that the children could not help stopping; and they remained there so long eating, that their mouths and cheeks became quite black with the juice.",joy
"At last they both lost themselves in the thicket; Christina began to cry, and then Ib cried too; and, after weeping and lamenting for some time, they stretched themselves down on the dry leaves and fell asleep.",sadness
"Great quantities of fish could be seen through the clear water, sparkling in the sun's rays; they were quite surprised when they came so suddenly upon such an unexpected sight.",surprise
"Out of the thicket stepped a tall old woman, her face quite brown, and her hair of a deep shining black; the whites of her eyes glittered like a Moor's; on her back she carried a bundle, and in her hand a knotted stick.",surprise
"She drew out of her pocket three large nuts, in which she told them were hidden the most beautiful and lovely things in the world, for they were wishing nuts.",surprise
"Ib looked at her, and as she spoke so kindly, he took courage, and asked her if she would give him the nuts; and the woman gave them to him, and then gathered some more from the bushes for herself, quite a pocket full.",joy
Ib and Christina looked at the wishing nuts with wide open eyes.,joy
"""There are ten neckerchiefs in it,"" she replied, ""as well as beautiful dresses, stockings, and a hat and veil.""",surprise
"""Then I will have that one also,"" said Christina; ""and it is a pretty one too.",joy
"""The best of all things for you,"" replied the gypsy.",joy
"In the wild wood-path they met a forester who knew Ib, and, by his help, Ib and Christina reached home, where they found every one had been very anxious about them.",joy
"But there was not much kernel to be seen; it was what we should call hollow or worm-eaten, and looked as if it had been filled with tobacco or rich black earth.",surprise
"""It is just what I expected!"" exclaimed Ib.",surprise
"""How should there be room in a little nut like this for the best thing of all?",anger
"One day, in the following spring, there came a knock at the door of the house where Ib's old mother lived; and when they opened it, lo and behold, in stepped the boatman and Christina.",surprise
"He could not utter a word; he could only seize her hand and hold it fast in his own, but he felt too happy and glad to open his lips.",joy
"Christina, however, was quite at her ease; she talked and talked, and kissed him in the most friendly manner.",joy
"Even afterwards, when they were left alone, and she asked, ""Did you know me again, Ib?"" he still stood holding her hand, and said at last, ""You are become quite a grand lady, Christina, and I am only a rough working man; but I have often thought of you and of old times.""",joy
"His eyes brightened, and the words he uttered came with hesitation from his lips, but from the deepest recesses of his heart: ""Christina, if you have not become too grand, and if you can be contented to live in my mother's house as my wife, we will be married some day.",joy
"""Oh yes,"" she replied; ""Let us wait a little longer, Ib.",joy
"I can trust you, for I believe that I do love you.",joy
"But let me think it over.""",surprise
Then he kissed her lips; and so they parted.,joy
"She was courted and admired by every one; but her master's son, who had been home on a visit, was so much pleased with Christina that he wished to marry her.",surprise
"At first Ib said not a word, but he became as white as the wall, and shook his head gently, and then he spoke,- ""Christina must not refuse this good fortune.""",sadness
"Ib sat down to write, but he could not get on at all.",sadness
"Very little was said about the matter to Ib, and he did not refer to it; his mother, however, noticed that he had grown very silent and pensive.",sadness
He understood the gypsy woman's meaning now.,joy
"During the two long years which followed, no letter came from Christina to her father; and when at last her father received one from her, it did not speak of prosperity or happiness.",surprise
Poor Christina!,sadness
"He searched, and found a large golden armlet of superior workmanship, and it was evident that the plough had disturbed a Hun's grave.",surprise
"He searched further, and found more valuable treasures, which Ib showed to the clergyman, who explained their value to him.",surprise
"""You have found in the earth the best thing you could find,"" said the magistrate.",joy
"""The best thing,"" thought Ib; ""the very best thing for me,- and found in the earth!",surprise
"Well, if it really is so, then the gypsy woman was right in her prophecy.""",joy
"At last a very little girl came out of one of the wretched-looking houses, and Ib asked her to tell him the way to the street he wanted; she looked up timidly at him, and began to cry bitterly.",sadness
"A strange sensation came over Ib, as he caught sight of it.",surprise
"The living, breathing embodiment of Little Christina stood before him, just as he remembered her in the days of her childhood.",surprise
"The air in the room was heavy and stifling, no light was burning, and from one corner came sounds of moaning and sighing.",sadness
He started as he did so.,surprise
It was Christina of the heath!,surprise
The cold hand of death had already touched the heart of Christina.,sadness
"Her youngest child, looked for in the midst of prosperity, had sunk into the grave when only a few weeks old; and at last Christina herself became sick unto death, and lay, forsaken and dying, in a miserable room, amid poverty she might have borne in her younger days, but which was now more painful to her from the luxuries to which she had lately been accustomed.",sadness
"It makes me unhappy to think that I shall die, and leave this poor child,"" sighed she.",sadness
"""Oh, what will become of her?""",sadness
He never knew; for not another word escaped her lips.,sadness
All was life and joy.,joy
"Ib's house was well and prettily furnished; for he was a prosperous man now, while the mother of the little girl rested in the churchyard at Copenhagen, where she had died in poverty.",joy
"This person, moreover, maintained that he belonged to a very old family in the land of Egypt, and that he was highly esteemed there.",joy
"""I sing so,"" he said, ""that sixteen native crickets who have chirped from their youth up, and have never yet had a card house of their own, would become thinner than they are with envy if they were to hear me.""",joy
That was very mean.,surprise

"I jumped to the highest; but in this world a body is required if one wishes to be seen.""",anger
"And he too said, ""Body is required! body is required!""",anger
"And then he sang his own melancholy song, and from that we have gathered this story, which they say is not true, though it's in print.",sadness
"On many a warm summer, the Ephemera, the flies that exist for only a day, had fluttered about the old oak, enjoyed life and felt happy and if, for a moment, one of the tiny creatures rested on one of his large fresh leaves, the tree would always say, ""Poor little creature! your whole life consists only of a single day.",joy
"""Melancholy! what do you mean?"" the little creature would always reply.",surprise
"""Everything around me is so wonderfully bright and warm, and beautiful, that it makes me joyous.""",joy
"""Over!"" repeated the fly; ""what is the meaning of all over?",surprise
"You may have thousands of my days, but I have thousands of moments in which I can be merry and happy.",joy
"And the little creature danced and floated in the air, rejoicing in her delicate wings of gauze and velvet, rejoicing in the balmy breezes, laden with the fragrance of clover-fields and wild roses, elder-blossoms and honeysuckle, from the garden hedges, wild thyme, primroses, and mint, and the scent of all these was so strong that the perfume almost intoxicated the little fly.",joy
"The long and beautiful day had been so full of joy and sweet delights, that when the sun sank low it felt tired of all its happiness and enjoyment.",joy
"Its wings could sustain it no longer, and gently and slowly it glided down upon the soft waving blades of grass, nodded its little head as well as it could nod, and slept peacefully and sweetly.",joy
"""Poor little Ephemera!"" said the oak; ""what a terribly short life!""",sadness
The same thing was continued through many generations of Ephemera; all of them felt equally merry and equally happy.,joy
"Crows and rooks came by turns and sat on them, and talked of the hard times which were beginning, and how difficult it was in winter to obtain food.",sadness
"The tree had, doubtless, a kind of feeling that the festive time had arrived, and in his dream fancied he heard the bells ringing from all the churches round, and yet it seemed to him to be a beautiful summer's day, mild and warm.",joy
"His mighty summits was crowned with spreading fresh green foliage; the sunbeams played among the leaves and branches, and the air was full of fragrance from herb and blossom; painted butterflies chased each other; the summer flies danced around him, as if the world had been created merely for them to dance and be merry in.",joy
"He saw lovers meet in quiet happiness near him in the moonshine, and carve the initials of their names in the grayish-green bark on his trunk.",joy
"Once, but long years had intervened since then, guitars and Eolian harps had been hung on his boughs by merry travellers; now they seemed to hang there again, and he could hear their marvellous tones.",joy
"Then it seemed as if new life was thrilling through every fibre of root and stem and leaf, rising even to the highest branches.",joy
"The tree felt itself stretching and spreading out, while through the root beneath the earth ran the warm vigor of life.",joy
"As he grew higher and still higher, with increased strength, his topmost boughs became broader and fuller; and in proportion to his growth, so was his self-satisfaction increased, and with it arose a joyous longing to grow higher and higher, to reach even to the warm, bright sun itself.",joy
"These were wonderful and happy moments for the old tree, full of peace and joy; and yet, amidst all this happiness, the tree felt a yearning, longing desire that all the other trees, bushes, herbs, and flowers beneath him, might be able also to rise higher, as he had done, and to see all this splendor, and experience the same happiness.",sadness
"The grand, majestic oak could not be quite happy in the midst of his enjoyment, while all the rest, both great and small, were not with him.",sadness
"And this feeling of yearning trembled through every branch, through every leaf, as warmly and fervently as if they had been the fibres of a human heart.",sadness
At length his longing was satisfied.,joy
"Up through the clouds came the green summits of the forest trees, and beneath him, the oak saw them rising, and growing higher and higher.",surprise
"May beetles hummed, the bees murmured, the birds sang, each in his own way; the air was filled with the sounds of song and gladness.""",joy
"""Why this is beautiful, too beautiful to be believed,"" said the oak in a joyful tone.",joy
"""I have them all here, both great and small; not one has been forgotten.",joy
"Can such happiness be imagined?""",joy
"""It is right so, it is best,"" said the tree, ""no fetters hold me now.",joy
I can fly up to the very highest point in light and glory.,joy

The root was torn from the ground just at the moment when in his dream he fancied it was being loosened from the earth.,surprise

"""I promise you I will not say it any more,"" said the other; but as soon as people came by, nodding to him, and wishing him ""Good day,"" he became so pleased, and thought how grand it looked to have five horses ploughing in his field, that he cried out again, ""Gee-up, all my horses!""",joy
"""I'll gee-up your horses for you,"" said Big Claus; and seizing a hammer, he struck the one horse of Little Claus on the head, and he fell dead instantly.",surprise

"""Hallo! what have you got in your sack!"" asked the farmer.",surprise
"""Wonderful!"" cried the farmer, starting up and opening the oven door; and there lay all the nice things hidden by the farmer's wife, but which he supposed had been conjured there by the wizard under the table.",surprise

"""I have been well paid for my horse,"" said he to himself when he reached home, entered his own room, and emptied all his money into a heap on the floor.",joy
"""What can he want it for?"" thought Great Claus; so he smeared the bottom of the measure with tar, that some of whatever was put into it might stick there and remain.",anger
"""Are you mad?"" they all cried; ""do you think we have money to spend by the bushel?""",surprise
"""He is making fools of us,"" said they all; then the shoemakers took their straps, and the tanners their leather aprons, and began to beat Great Claus.",anger
"""Skins, skins!"" they cried, mocking him; ""yes, we'll mark your skin for you, till it is black and blue.""",anger
"""Out of the town with him,"" said they.",anger
"""Ah,"" said he, as he came to his house; ""Little Claus shall pay me for this; I will beat him to death.""",anger
"She had been cross, unkind, and really spiteful to him; but he was very sorry, and took the dead woman and laid her in his warm bed to see if he could bring her to life again.",sadness
"""There,"" cried he, ""now you cannot make a fool of me again;"" and then he went home.",anger
"""That is a very wicked man,"" thought Little Claus; ""he meant to kill me.",surprise
"The landlord was a rich man, and a good man too; but as passionate as if he had been made of pepper and snuff.",anger
"Again and again he bawled it out, but as she did not stir he flew into a passion, and threw the glass of mead in her face; it struck her on the nose, and she fell backwards out of the cart, for she was only seated there, not tied in.",anger
"Hallo!"" cried Little Claus, rushing out of the door, and seizing hold of the landlord by the throat; ""you have killed my grandmother; see, here is a great hole in her forehead.""",surprise
"""Oh, how unfortunate,"" said the landlord, wringing his hands.",surprise
"""This all comes of my fiery temper.",anger
"""How is this?"" thought Great Claus; ""did I not kill him?",surprise
"""How did you get all this money?"" asked Great Claus, staring with wide open eyes at his neighbor's treasures.",surprise

"""You have played me another trick,"" said he.",anger
"""First, I killed all my horses, and then my old grandmother, and it is all your fault; but you shall not make a fool of me any more.""",anger

"At the same time, the kind-hearted old man who lived by himself in the upper storey of the house came in; he led a lonely life, for he had no wife and children; but he loved the children of others very much, and he could tell so many fairy tales and stories, that it was a pleasure to hear him.",joy

"""Here it is splendid in summer!"" she said, and they passed by old castles of the age of chivalry.",joy

"""My poor flowers are quite dead,"" said little Ida, ""they were so pretty yesterday evening, and now all the leaves are hanging down quite withered.",sadness
"What do they do that for,"" she asked, of the student who sat on the sofa; she liked him very much, he could tell the most amusing stories, and cut out the prettiest pictures; hearts, and ladies dancing, castles with doors that opened, as well as flowers; he was a delightful student.",joy

"""Oh how funny!"" said Ida, and she laughed.",joy
"""How can anyone put such notions into a child's head?"" said a tiresome lawyer, who had come to pay a visit, and sat on the sofa.",anger
"He did not like the student, and would grumble when he saw him cutting out droll or amusing pictures.",anger
"But the lawyer did not like such jokes, and he would say as he had just said, ""How can anyone put such nonsense into a child's head! what absurd fancies there are!""",anger
"But to little Ida, all these stories which the student told her about the flowers, seemed very droll, and she thought over them a great deal.",joy

"They did not look ill at all now, but jumped about and were very merry, yet none of them noticed little Ida.",joy
"The carnival rod hopped about among the flowers on its three red stilted feet, and stamped quite loud when it danced the Mazurka; the flowers could not perform this dance, they were too light to stamp in that manner.",joy

"""You are not kind at all,"" said Ida; ""and yet they all danced with you.""",anger
"Ida kissed her flowers and then laid them, with the box, in the earth.",joy
"In the cold and the darkness, a poor little girl, with bare head and naked feet, roamed through the streets.",sadness
"No one had bought anything of her the whole day, nor had any one given here even a penny.",sadness
"Shivering with cold and hunger, she crept along; poor little child, she looked the picture of misery.",sadness
"In a corner, between two houses, one of which projected beyond the other, she sank down and huddled herself together.",sadness
It was really a wonderful light.,joy
"It seemed to the little girl that she was sitting by a large iron stove, with polished brass feet and a brass ornament.",joy
"How the fire burned! and seemed so beautifully warm that the child stretched out her feet as if to warm them, when, lo! the flame of the match went out, the stove vanished, and she had only the remains of the half-burnt match in her hand.",surprise
"Then the match went out, and there remained nothing but the thick, damp, cold wall before her.",sadness
"She lighted another match, and then she found herself sitting under a beautiful Christmas-tree.",joy
"The little one stretched out her hand towards them, and the match went out.",surprise
"""Some one is dying,"" thought the little girl, for her old grandmother, the only one who had ever loved her, and who was now dead, had told her that when a star falls, a soul was going up to God.",sadness
"She again rubbed a match on the wall, and the light shone round her; in the brightness stood her old grandmother, clear and shining, yet mild and loving in her appearance.",joy
"""Grandmother,"" cried the little one, ""O take me with you; I know you will go away when the match burns out; you will vanish like the warm stove, the roast goose, and the large, glorious Christmas-tree.""",sadness
"And the matches glowed with a light that was brighter than the noon-day, and her grandmother had never appeared so large or so beautiful.",joy
"She took the little girl in her arms, and they both flew upwards in brightness and joy far above the earth, where there was neither cold nor hunger nor pain, for they were with God.",joy
"In the dawn of morning there lay the poor little one, with pale cheeks and smiling mouth, leaning against the wall; she had been frozen to death on the last evening of the year; and the New-year's sun rose and shone upon a little corpse!",surprise
"""Oh, that can be easily managed,"" said the fairy.",joy
"""Thank you,"" said the woman, and she gave the fairy twelve shillings, which was the price of the barleycorn.",joy
"""It is a beautiful flower,"" said the woman, and she kissed the red and golden-colored leaves, and while she did so the flower opened, and she could see that it was a real tulip.",joy
"Here she slept at night, but during the day she amused herself on a table, where the woman had placed a plateful of water.",joy
"One night, while she lay in her pretty bed, a large, ugly, wet toad crept through a broken pane of glass in the window, and leaped right upon the table where Tiny lay sleeping under her rose-leaf quilt.",surprise
"""What a pretty little wife this would make for my son, said the toad, and she took up the walnut-shell in which little Tiny lay asleep, and jumped through the window with it into the garden.",surprise
"The tiny little creature woke very early in the morning, and began to cry bitterly when she found where she was, for she could see nothing but water on every side of the large green leaf, and no way of reaching the land.",sadness
"The old toad bowed low to her in the water, and said, ""Here is my son, he will be your husband, and you will live happily in the marsh by the stream.""",joy
"""Croak, croak, croak,"" was all her son could say for himself; so the toad took up the elegant little bed, and swam away with it, leaving Tiny all alone on the green leaf, where she sat and wept.",sadness
"She could not bear to think of living with the old toad, and having her ugly son for a husband.",sadness
"As soon as they caught sight of her, they saw she was very pretty, and it made them very sorry to think that she must go and live with the ugly toads.",sadness
"""No, it must never be!"" so they assembled together in the water, round the green stalk which held the leaf on which the little maiden stood, and gnawed it away at the root with their teeth.",sadness
"Tiny pleased him, and she was glad of it, for now the toad could not possibly reach her, and the country through which she sailed was beautiful, and the sun shone upon the water, till it glittered like liquid gold.",joy
"Presently a large cockchafer flew by; the moment he caught sight of her, he seized her round her delicate waist with his claws, and flew with her into a tree.",surprise
"But especially was she sorry for the beautiful white butterfly which she had fastened to the leaf, for if he could not free himself he would die of hunger.",sadness
"After a time, all the cockchafers turned up their feelers, and said, ""She has only two legs! how ugly that looks.""",surprise
"""She has no feelers,"" said another.",anger
"""Her waist is quite slim.",anger
"Pooh! she is like a human being.""",anger
"""Oh! she is ugly,"" said all the lady cockchafers, although Tiny was very pretty.",anger
"Then the cockchafer who had run away with her, believed all the others when they said she was ugly, and would have nothing more to say to her, and told her she might go where she liked.",anger
"Then he flew down with her from the tree, and placed her on a daisy, and she wept at the thought that she was so ugly that even the cockchafers would have nothing to say to her.",sadness
During the whole summer poor little Tiny lived quite alone in the wide forest.,sadness
"She felt dreadfully cold, for her clothes were torn, and she was herself so frail and delicate, that poor little Tiny was nearly frozen to death.",sadness
"Then she wrapped herself up in a dry leaf, but it cracked in the middle and could not keep her warm, and she shivered with cold.",sadness
Oh! how she shivered with the cold.,sadness
"There dwelt the field-mouse in warmth and comfort, with a whole roomful of corn, a kitchen, and a beautiful dining room.",joy
"Poor little Tiny stood before the door just like a little beggar-girl, and begged for a small piece of barley-corn, for she had been without a morsel to eat for two days.",sadness
"""You poor little creature,"" said the field-mouse, who was really a good old field-mouse, ""come into my warm room and dine with me.""",sadness
"She was very pleased with Tiny, so she said, ""You are quite welcome to stay with me all the winter, if you like; but you must keep my rooms clean and neat, and tell me stories, for I shall like to hear them very much.""",joy
"And Tiny did all the field-mouse asked her, and found herself very comfortable.",joy
"But Tiny did not feel at all interested about this neighbor, for he was a mole.",anger
"And the mole fell in love with her because she had such a sweet voice; but he said nothing yet, for he was very cautious.",joy
"In the middle of the floor lay a dead swallow, his beautiful wings pulled close to his sides, his feet and his head drawn up under his feathers; the poor bird had evidently died of the cold.",sadness
"It made little Tiny very sad to see it, she did so love the little birds; all the summer they had sung and twittered for her so beautifully.",sadness
"""Perhaps this was the one who sang to me so sweetly in the summer,"" she said; ""and how much pleasure it gave me, you dear, pretty bird.""",joy
"""Farewell, you pretty little bird,"" said she, ""farewell; thank you for your delightful singing during the summer, when all the trees were green, and the warm sun shone upon us.",sadness
"Then she laid her head on the bird's breast, but she was alarmed immediately, for it seemed as if something inside the bird went ""thump, thump.""",surprise
"It was the bird's heart; he was not really dead, only benumbed with the cold, and the warmth had restored him to life.",surprise
"""Thank you, pretty little maiden,"" said the sick swallow; ""I have been so nicely warmed, that I shall soon regain my strength, and be able to fly about again in the warm sunshine.""",joy
"Stay in your warm bed; I will take care of you.""",joy
"Then she brought the swallow some water in a flower-leaf, and after he had drank, he told her that he had wounded one of his wings in a thorn-bush, and could not fly as fast as the others, who were soon far away on their journey to warm countries.",sadness
"The whole winter the swallow remained underground, and Tiny nursed him with care and love.",joy
"The sun shone in upon them so beautifully, that the swallow asked her if she would go with him; she could sit on his back, he said, and he would fly away with her into the green woods.",joy
"But Tiny knew it would make the field-mouse very grieved if she left her in that manner, so she said, ""No, I cannot.""",sadness
"Tiny looked after him, and the tears rose in her eyes.",sadness
"""Tweet, tweet,"" sang the bird, as he flew out into the green woods, and Tiny felt very sad.",sadness
What good fortune for a poor child like you.,joy
"Nothing must be wanting when you are the mole's wife.""",joy
But Tiny was not at all pleased; for she did not like the tiresome mole.,sadness
"Every morning when the sun rose, and every evening when it went down, she would creep out at the door, and as the wind blew aside the ears of corn, so that she could see the blue sky, she thought how beautiful and bright it seemed out there, and wished so much to see her dear swallow again.",sadness
"Then Tiny wept, and said she would not marry the disagreeable mole.",sadness
"""Nonsense,"" replied the field-mouse.",anger
"""Now don't be obstinate, or I shall bite you with my white teeth.",anger
"You ought to be very thankful for such good fortune.""",anger
"The poor child was very unhappy at the thought of saying farewell to the beautiful sun, and as the field-mouse had given her permission to stand at the door, she went to look at it once more.",sadness
"""Farewell bright sun,"" she cried, stretching out her arm towards it; and then she walked a short distance from the house; for the corn had been cut, and only the dry stubble remained in the fields.",sadness
"""Farewell, farewell,"" she repeated, twining her arm round a little red flower that grew just by her side.",sadness
"""Tweet, tweet,"" sounded over her head suddenly.",surprise
"She looked up, and there was the swallow himself flying close by.",surprise
"As soon as he spied Tiny, he was delighted; and then she told him how unwilling she felt to marry the ugly mole, and to live always beneath the earth, and never to see the bright sun any more.",joy
And as she told him she wept.,sadness
"""Yes, I will go with you,"" said Tiny; and she seated herself on the bird's back, with her feet on his outstretched wings, and tied her girdle to one of his strongest feathers.",joy
"You must choose for yourself one of those lovely flowers, and I will put you down upon it, and then you shall have everything that you can wish to make you happy.""",joy
"""That will be delightful,"" she said, and clapped her little hands for joy.",joy
"But how surprised she was to see in the middle of the flower, a tiny little man, as white and transparent as if he had been made of crystal!",surprise
"""Oh, how beautiful he is!"" whispered Tiny to the swallow.",joy
"The little prince was at first quite frightened at the bird, who was like a giant, compared to such a delicate little creature as himself; but when he saw Tiny, he was delighted, and thought her the prettiest little maiden he had ever seen.",joy
"This certainly was a very different sort of husband to the son of a toad, or the mole, with my black velvet and fur; so she said, ""Yes,"" to the handsome prince.",joy
"Then all the flowers opened, and out of each came a little lady or a tiny lord, all so pretty it was quite a pleasure to look at them.",joy
"Then there was much rejoicing, and the little swallow who sat above them, in his nest, was asked to sing a wedding song, which he did as well as he could; but in his heart he felt sad for he was very fond of Tiny, and would have liked never to part from her again.",sadness
"We will call you Maia.""",joy
"""Farewell, farewell,"" said the swallow, with a heavy heart as he left the warm countries to fly back into Denmark.",sadness
"He still lay thinking and thinking, when all at once it seemed as if some one kissed him on his eyes and mouth.",surprise
"He was very proud, and said, ""Thorwalsden lived close to me, and here I am now, quite comfortable.""",joy
But now little Tuk was no longer in bed; all in a moment he found himself on horseback.,surprise
Within there were songs and dancing; King Waldemar and the young gayly-dressed ladies of the court were dancing together.,joy
"One tower after another fell, till at last only one remained standing on the hill where the castle had formerly been.",surprise
"But I am fragrant with perfume, for close to my gates most lovely roses bloom.""",joy
All at once everything vanished; but where!,surprise
"""Yes, that it has,"" said she, and then, just as she was going to tell him a great many pretty stories from Holberg's comedies, and about Waldemar and Absalom, she suddenly shrunk up together, and wagged her head as if she were a frog about to spring.",surprise
Then little Tuk saw she was changed into a frog.,surprise
"How it sounded like the cry of the frogs on the moor, or like the creaking of great boots when some one is marching,- always the same tone, so monotonous and wearing, that little Tuk at length fell fast asleep, and then the sound could not annoy him.",joy
"The bird of good omen shall be yours, and you shall become a rich and happy man; your house shall rise up like King Waldemar's towers, and shall be richly adorned with marble statues, like those at Prastoe.",joy
"Understand me well; your name shall travel with fame round the world like the ship that was to sail from Corsor, and at Roeskilde,- Don't forget the names of the towns, as King Hroar said,- you shall speak well and clearly little Tuk, and when at last you lie in your grave you shall sleep peacefully, as-"" ""As if I lay in Soroe,"" said little Tuk awaking.",joy
"The old washerwoman put her head in at the door, and nodded to him quite kindly, and said, ""Many thanks, you good child, for your help yesterday.",joy
"I hope all your beautiful dreams will come true.""",joy
"She specially loved roses, and therefore she possessed the most beautiful varieties of this flower, from the wild hedge-rose, with its apple-scented leaves, to the splendid Provence rose.",joy
"But care and sorrow dwelt within these halls; the queen lay upon a sick bed, and the doctors declared that she must die.",sadness
"""No one has yet named the flower,"" said the wise man.",sadness
"""No one has pointed out the spot where it blooms in all its splendor.",sadness
"""I know where it blooms,"" said a happy mother, who came with her lovely child to the bedside of the queen.",joy
"""I know where the loveliest rose in the world is.",joy
"It is seen on the blooming cheeks of my sweet child, when it expresses the pure and holy love of infancy; when refreshed by sleep it opens its eyes, and smiles upon me with childlike affection.""",joy
"She wept over it, kissed it, and prayed for it as only a mother can pray in that hour of her anguish.""",sadness
"""May she be blessed!"" said the wise man: ""but no one has yet named the loveliest rose in the world.""",joy
"Tears stood in his eyes, and glistened on his cheeks; he carried a great book and the binding was of velvet, with silver clasps.",sadness
"""Mother,"" cried the little boy; ""only hear what I have read.""",sadness
"He read, ""Greater love hath no man than this,"" and as he read a roseate hue spread over the cheeks of the queen, and her eyes became so enlightened and clear, that she saw from the leaves of the book a lovely rose spring forth, a type of Him who shed His blood on the cross.",joy
"""I see it,"" she said.",joy
"""Hurrah! hurrah!"" cried the people in the town; for in every house the New Year was being welcomed; and as the clock struck, they stood up, the full glasses in their hands, to drink success to the new comer.",joy
"""A happy New Year,"" was the cry; ""a pretty wife, plenty of money, and no sorrow or care.""",joy
He seemed a merry fellow.,joy
"""We'll dance the bung out of the cask at carnival time,"" said he; ""I'll prepare a merry tune for you and for myself too.",joy
"Unfortunately I have not long to live- the shortest time, in fact, of my whole family- only twenty-eight days.",sadness
"Hurrah!""",joy
"""You must not shout so,"" said the sentry.",anger
"But it was not true; the speaker only wanted to remind him of his name, and to make an APRIL fool of him; for with that fun the fourth generally began his career.",surprise
"He looked very jovial, did little work, and had the more holidays.",joy
"""Your health, and God bless you,"" was her salutation to him.",joy
"How pretty she was! and such a singer! not a theatre singer, nor a ballad singer; no, but a singer of the woods; for she wandered through the gay green forest, and had a concert there for her own amusement.",joy
"""Now comes the young lady,"" said those in the carriage; and out stepped a young dame, delicate, proud, and pretty.",joy
"After work, came the recreations, dancing and playing in the greenwood, and the ""harvest homes.""",joy
"This was an ornament to the jug, and he has a great love for ornament.",joy
"A land-owner followed, who in the month for sowing seed attended to the ploughing and was fond of field sports.",joy
"It was NOVEMBER, who coughed violently as he got out.",sadness
"The dame was very old, but her eyes glistened like two stars.",joy
"""This tree I shall guard and cherish,"" she said, ""that it may grow large by Christmas Eve, and reach from the ground to the ceiling, to be covered and adorned with flaming candles, golden apples, and little figures.",joy
"""Well, now the coach may drive away,"" said the sentry; ""we have the whole twelve.",joy
"It is quite a picture to see a half-naked boy clasping the well-formed creature by the head, as he presses his rosy lips against its jaws.",surprise
"In the garden of the grand duke's palace, under the roof of one of the wings, where a thousand roses bloom in winter, a little ragged boy had been sitting the whole day long; a boy, who might serve as a type of Italy, lovely and smiling, and yet still suffering.",sadness
"He was hungry and thirsty, yet no one gave him anything; and when it became dark, and they were about to close the gardens, the porter turned him out.",sadness
"The Metal Pig raised himself gently, and the boy heard him say quite distinctly, ""Hold tight, little boy, for I am going to run;"" and away he started for a most wonderful ride.",surprise
The little boy said not a word; he was half pleased and half afraid.,joy
"But the grandest appeared when the door of a side room opened; the little boy could remember what beautiful things he had seen there, but to-night everything shone in its brightest colors.",joy
"The boy was dazzled by so much glitter; for the walls were gleaming with bright colors, all appeared living reality.",surprise
"As they passed from hall to hall, beauty everywhere showed itself; and as the Metal Pig went step by step from one picture to the other, the little boy could see it all plainly.",joy
"One glory eclipsed another; yet there was one picture that fixed itself on the little boy's memory, more especially because of the happy children it represented, for these the little boy had seen in daylight.",joy
"The Florentine, Angiolo Bronzino, painted this picture; most beautiful is the expression on the face of the two children, who appear to have full confidence that they shall reach heaven at last.",joy
"They are embracing each other, and one little one stretches out his hand towards another who stands below him, and points to himself, as if he were saying, ""I am going to heaven.""",joy
"The older people stand as if uncertain, yet hopeful, and they bow in humble adoration to the Lord Jesus.",joy
"The boy raised his hands towards the smiling children, and then the Pig ran off with him through the open vestibule.",joy
"""Thank you, thank you, you beautiful animal,"" said the little boy, caressing the Metal Pig as it ran down the steps.",joy
"""Thanks to yourself also,"" replied the Metal Pig; ""I have helped you and you have helped me, for it is only when I have an innocent child on my back that I receive the power to run.",joy
"Yes; as you see, I can even venture under the rays of the lamp, in front of the picture of the Madonna, but I may not enter the church; still from without, and while you are upon my back, I may look in through the open door.",sadness
"""I will stay with you, my dear creature,"" said the little boy.",joy
"The boy stretched forth his hands towards the light, and at the same moment the Metal Pig started again so rapidly that he was obliged to cling tightly to him.",surprise
"The wind whistled in his ears, he heard the church door creak on its hinges as it closed, and it seemed to him as if he had lost his senses- then a cold shudder passed over him, and he awoke.",surprise
"Once more he clasped the neck of his metal horse, kissed its nose, and nodded farewell to it.",sadness
"Another broken-down staircase led from the gallery, and two Russian sailors running down it almost upset the poor boy.",surprise
"This pot she took in her lap, warmed her fingers, and pushed the boy with her elbow.",surprise
"""Certainly you must have some money,"" she said.",anger
"The boy began to cry, and then she struck him with her foot till he cried out louder.",sadness
"""Will you be quiet? or I'll break your screaming head;"" and she swung about the fire-pot which she held in her hand, while the boy crouched to the earth and screamed.",anger
"""Felicita,"" she said, ""what are you doing to the child?""",anger
"""The child is mine,"" she answered; ""I can murder him if I like, and you too, Giannina.""",anger
And then she swung about the fire-pot.,anger
"Here everything was bright, and the boy knelt down by the first tomb on his right, the grave of Michael Angelo, and sobbed as if his heart would break.",sadness
"Hunger and thirst overpowered the child, and he became quite faint and ill.",sadness
"A little white poodle, so closely shaven that his pink skin could plainly be seen, frisked about the room, and gambolled upon the boy.",joy
"""Innocent souls are soon intimate,"" said the woman, as she caressed both the boy and the dog.",joy
"These good people gave the child food and drink, and said he should stay with them all night, and that the next day the old man, who was called Giuseppe, would go and speak to his mother.",joy
"A little homely bed was prepared for him, but to him who had so often slept on the hard stones it was a royal couch, and he slept sweetly and dreamed of the splendid pictures and of the Metal Pig.",joy
"He wept at the thought, and then he played with the little, lively dog, and kissed it, while the old woman looked kindly at him to encourage him.",sadness
"Then she said, ""He is a good lad, he shall stay with us, he may become a clever glovemaker, like you.",joy
"So the boy stayed with them, and the woman herself taught him to sew; and he ate well, and slept well, and became very merry.",joy
"This made the woman angry, and she scolded him and threatened him, which made him very unhappy, and he went and sat in his own room full of sad thoughts.",anger
Suddenly he fancied he heard feet outside going pit-a-pat.,surprise
But there was nothing to be seen; whatever he had heard had passed already.,sadness
"They stopped before the picture by Bronzino, in which Christ is represented as standing in the lower world, with the children smiling before Him, in the sweet expectation of entering heaven; and the poor boy smiled, too, for here was his heaven.",joy
"""Why don't you go?"" said the painter.",anger
"""You happy creature,"" he said; ""how I have longed for you! we must take a ride to-night.""",joy
"But the Metal Pig lay motionless, while the fresh stream gushed forth from its mouth.",surprise
"He looked down, and there was Bellissima, little smooth-shaven Bellissima, barking as if she would have said, ""Here I am too; why are you sitting there?""",surprise
"""Bellissima in the street, and not dressed!"" as the old lady called it; ""what would be the end of this?""",surprise
"The poor little thing trembled so with cold, that the boy ran homeward as fast as he could.",sadness
"""Where have you stolen that pretty dog?"" they asked; and they took it away from him.",surprise
"""Oh, I have not stolen it; do give it to me back again,"" cried the boy, despairingly.",anger
"""You bad boy! how did you entice her out?",anger
"Giuseppe went off at once, while his wife lamented, and the boy wept.",sadness
"The painter, however, consoled the little fellow, and tried to soften the lady's anger; but she would not be pacified till her husband returned with Bellissima, who had been with the police.",anger
"Then there was great rejoicing, and the painter caressed the boy, and gave him a number of pictures.",joy
"Oh, what beautiful pictures these were!- figures with funny heads; and, above all, the Metal Pig was there too.",joy
"Oh, nothing could be more delightful.",joy
"The first leisure moment during the next day, the boy got a pencil, and on the back of one of the other drawings he attempted to copy the drawing of the Metal Pig, and he succeeded.",joy
"Certainly it was rather crooked, rather up and down, one leg thick, and another thin; still it was like the copy, and he was overjoyed at what he had done.",joy
"A second pig was drawn by the side of the first, and this looked a hundred times better; and the third attempt was so good, that everybody might know what it was meant to represent.",joy
"His collection of pictures increased; but as yet they were only copies of lifeless objects, when one day Bellissima came gambolling before him: ""Stand still,"" cried he, ""and I will draw you beautifully, to put amongst my collection.""",joy
"He tied her head and tail; but she barked and jumped, and so pulled and tightened the string, that she was nearly strangled; and just then her mistress walked in.",anger
"""You wicked boy! the poor little creature!"" was all she could utter.",anger
"She pushed the boy from her, thrust him away with her foot, called him a most ungrateful, good-for-nothing, wicked boy, and forbade him to enter the house again.",anger
"Then she wept, and kissed her little half-strangled Bellissima.",anger
"A large gilt frame surrounded it, and on one corner of the frame a laurel wreath had been hung; but a black band, twined unseen among the green leaves, and a streamer of crape, hung down from it; for within the last few days the young artist had- died.",sadness
"He knew very well that he had enough inside him to buy up all the other toys, and this gave him a very good opinion of his own value.",joy
"Upon this there was a great uproar; even the engravings, which hung in frames on the wall, turned round in their excitement, and showed that they had a wrong side to them, although they had not the least intention to expose themselves in this way, or to object to the game.",joy
"And as the game was now to begin, all were invited to take part in it, even the children's wagon, which certainly belonged to the coarser playthings.",joy
"When the play at the little theatre began, the rest sat and looked on; they were requested to applaud and stamp, or crack, when they felt gratified with what they saw.",joy
"""I crack for everybody,"" said the cracker.",joy
"""Yes, and a fine noise you make,"" thought the audience, as the play went on.",joy
"The doll, whose neck had been darned, was so excited that the place in her neck burst, and the money-pig declared he must do something for one of the players, as they had all pleased him so much.",joy
"They all enjoyed the comedy so much, that they gave up all thoughts of the tea party, and only carried out their idea of intellectual amusement, which they called playing at men and women; and there was nothing wrong about it, for it was only play.",joy
"Certainly sooner than he expected- for all at once down he came from the top of the press, fell on the ground, and was broken to pieces.",surprise
"The sun shone among the delicate leaves; everything breathed forth the loveliest fragrance, and all felt as we do when we are filled with joy at the thought of our happiness.",joy
"""How beautiful existence is!"" said each rose.",joy
"We have good neighbours, both below and above.",joy
"How beautiful existence is!""",joy
"""If you must ask questions, ask sensible ones,"" said their mother.",anger
"""Don't you see that they are feathers, such as I wear and you will wear too?",anger

"I am heartily tired of such neighbours.""",anger
What a pleasure that must be!,joy
"It is fine to have such cheerful neighbours.""",joy
"The other roses looked after their sister, and asked each other, ""Where can she be going to?""",surprise
"The whole day long the sun shines bright and warm, and in the night the sky shines more beautifully still; we can see that through all the little holes in it.""",joy
"""We make it lively about the house,"" said the sparrow-mother; ""and people say that a swallows' nest brings luck; so they are glad of us.",joy
But such neighbours as ours!,anger
"The roses are good for nothing but to be looked at and to be smelt, or at most to be stuck in a hat.",anger
"You see, that's their life; they exist only for the eye and the nose.",anger
"But they were very pleased with it, and wondered whether all the little sparrows could become nightingales.",joy
"""Nothing at all,"" answered their mother; ""that's only something external.",anger
If they were only plucked a little they would look no better than the rest of us.,anger
"I would have plucked them already if they had not been so big.""",anger

"""Now I see that it is Sunday,"" said the husband, kissing his little wife.",joy
"They sat down, read their hymn-book, and held each other by the hand, while the sun shone down upon the fresh roses and upon them.",joy
"""This sight is really too tedious,"" said the sparrow-mother, who could see into the room from her nest; and she flew away.",anger
"In one of her flights, however it may have happened, she was caught, before she was aware of it, in a horse-hair net which some boys had attached to a tree.",surprise
"""It's only a sparrow,"" they said; they did not, however, let her go, but took her home with them, and every time she cried they hit her on the beak.",anger
"He was a merry old man, always wandering about.",joy
How she glittered!,surprise
"All the sparrows, and even a crow- and an old boy he was too- were startled at the sight; but still they flew after her to learn what kind of strange bird she was.",surprise
"""Look at her!",surprise
"Look at her!"" they all cried.",surprise
"""Look at her!",surprise
"Look at her"" cried her little ones. as she approached the nest.",surprise
"""That is certainly a young peacock, for it glitters in all colours; it makes one's eyes ache, as mother told us.",surprise
"Peep! that's 'the beautiful'.""",surprise

"The sparrow spread out her wings once more, then drew them closely to her, and lay dead near the neighbouring family, the beautiful fresh roses.",surprise
"""But I am the eldest!"" exclaimed the third.",anger

"And a shoal of other little fishes put their heads out, and laughed at Mr. Jeremy Fisher.",joy
"And while Mr. Jeremy sat disconsolately on the edge of his boat--sucking his sore fingers and peering down into the water--a MUCH worse thing happened; a really FRIGHTFUL thing it would have been, if Mr. Jeremy had not been wearing a mackintosh!",sadness
"A great big enormous trout came up--ker-pflop-p-p-p! with a splash-- and it seized Mr. Jeremy with a snap, ""Ow!",surprise
Ow!,surprise
"Ow!""--and then it turned and dived down to the bottom of the pond!",surprise
"But the trout was so displeased with the taste of the mackintosh, that in less than half a minute it spat him out again; and the only thing it swallowed was Mr. Jeremy's galoshes.",anger
"""What a mercy that was not a pike!"" said Mr. Jeremy Fisher.",joy
"""I have lost my rod and basket; but it does not much matter, for I am sure I should never have dared to go fishing again!""",surprise
The rabbits could not bear him; they could smell him half a mile off.,anger
He was friendly with old Mr. Bouncer; they agreed in disliking the wicked otters and Mr. Tod; they often talked over that painful subject.,anger
"He complained bitterly about the scarcity of pheasants' eggs, and accused Mr. Tod of poaching them.",anger
"And the otters had cleared off all the frogs while he was asleep in winter--""I have not had a good square meal for a fort- night, I am living on pig-nuts.",anger
"I shall have to turn vegetarian and eat my own tail!"" said Tommy Brock.",anger
"It was not much of a joke, but it tickled old Mr. Bouncer; because Tommy Brock was so fat and stumpy and grinning.",joy
"So old Mr. Bouncer laughed; and pressed Tommy Brock to come inside, to taste a slice of seed cake and ""a glass of my daughter Flopsy's cowslip wine.""",joy
"Then old Mr. Bouncer smoked another pipe, and gave Tommy Brock a cabbage leaf cigar which was so very strong that it made Tommy Brock grin more than ever; and the smoke filled the burrow.",joy
Old Mr. Bouncer coughed and laughed; and Tommy Brock puffed and grinned.,joy
"And Mr. Bouncer laughed and coughed, and shut his eyes because of the cabbage smoke ..........",joy
"He was in disgrace; Flopsy wrung her ears, and slapped him.",anger
Benjamin Bunny set off at once after Tommy Brock.,anger
Other rabbits were coming out to enjoy the evening air.,joy
"Peter Rabbit, Peter Rabbit!"" shouted Benjamin Bunny.",surprise

"Is it a cat? or John Stoat Ferret?""",surprise
"""Tommy Brock? how many, Cousin Benjamin?""",surprise
"""My Uncle Bouncer has displayed a lamentable want of discretion for his years;"" said Peter reflectively, ""but there are two hopeful circumstances.",sadness
"""He must be very puffed; we are close behind him, by the scent.",surprise
"What a nasty person!"" said Peter.",anger
Benjamin sighed with relief.,joy
But there were preparations upon the kitchen table which made him shudder.,surprise
"What a dreadful place; I shall never see them again!"" sighed Benjamin.",sadness
"But alas, no little rabbit babies were to be seen!",sadness
And presently at the same moment Peter and Benjamin noticed that whenever they shook the window the little door opposite shook in answer.,surprise
The young family were alive; shut up in the oven!,surprise
"Benjamin was so excited that it was a mercy he did not awake Tommy Brock, whose snores continued solemnly in Mr. Tod's bed.",joy
"Again from the fields down below in the mist there came the angry cry of a jay, followed by the sharp yelping bark of a fox!",surprise
"Mr. Tod was coming up Bull Banks, and he was in the very worst of tempers.",anger
First he had been upset by breaking the plate.,anger
Then the midges had been very bad.,anger
"And he had failed to catch a hen pheasant on her nest; and it had contained only five eggs, two of them addled.",anger
Mr. Tod had had an unsatisfactory night.,anger
"As usual, when out of humor, he determined to move house.",anger
He made his way up the hill; his temper was not improved by noticing unmistakable marks of badger.,anger
Mr. Tod slapped his stick upon the earth and fumed; he guessed where Tommy Brock had gone to.,anger
He was further annoyed by the jay bird which followed him persistently.,anger
"Once when it flew screaming over his head Mr. Tod snapped at it, and barked.",anger
The sight that met Mr. Tod's eyes in Mr. Tod's kitchen made Mr. Tod furious.,anger
His whiskers bristled and his coat collar stood on end with rage.,anger
"When he was outside the house, he scratched up the earth with fury.",anger
He was an incurably indolent person; he was not in the least afraid of Mr. Tod; he was simply too lazy and comfortable to move.,anger
It creaked; he turned round with a jump.,surprise
"Tommy Brock opened both eyes, and looked at the rope and grinned.",joy
He was puzzled.,surprise
"""I will wake him up with an unpleasant surprise,"" said Mr. Tod.",joy
"The moment he had gone, Tommy Brock got up in a hurry; he rolled Mr. Tod's dressing-gown into a bundle, put it into the bed beneath the pail of water instead of himself, and left the room also-- grinning immensely.",joy
"At last the rope gave way with such a sudden jerk that it nearly pulled his teeth out, and quite knocked him over backwards.",surprise
"Mr. Tod was mystified; he sat quite still, and listened attentively.",surprise
"Yes--there was no doubt about it--it had turned out even better than he had planned; the pail had hit poor old Tommy Brock, and killed him dead!",joy
"""I will bury that nasty person in the hole which he has dug.",joy
I must have a disinfecting.,anger
He was quite dry himself and grinning; and he threw the cup of scalding tea all over Mr. Tod.,joy
"Then Mr. Tod rushed upon Tommy Brock, and Tommy Brock grappled with Mr. Tod amongst the broken crockery, and there was a terrific battle all over the kitchen.",anger
"When the kettle fell, Tommy Brock, who was still grinning, happened to be uppermost; and he rolled Mr. Tod over and over like a log, out at the door.",joy
"Then the snarling and worrying went on outside; and they rolled over the bank, and down hill, bumping over the rocks.",anger
There will never be any love lost between Tommy Brock and Mr. Tod.,anger
"""Now for it!",joy
"Run in, Cousin Benjamin!",joy
"Run in and get them! while I watch the door.""",joy
"At home in the rabbit hole, things had not been quite comfortable.",anger
"After quarreling at supper, Flopsy and old Mr. Bouncer had passed a sleepless night, and quarrelled again at breakfast.",anger
Old Mr. Bouncer could no longer deny that he had invited company into the rabbit hole; but he refused to reply to the questions and reproaches of Flopsy.,anger
"Old Mr. Bouncer, very sulky, was huddled up in a corner, barricaded with a chair.",anger
"""I've got them!",joy
Great was old Mr. Bouncer's relief and Flopsy's joy when Peter and Benjamin arrived in triumph with the young family.,joy
The rabbit babies were rather tumbled and very hungry; they were fed and put to bed.,sadness
He was rather upon his dignity; but he accepted.,joy
"Old Mr. Bouncer was forgiven, and they all had dinner.",joy
"And then, feeling rather sick, he went to look for some parsley.",sadness
"But round the end of a cucumber frame, whom should he meet but Mr. McGregor!",surprise
"Mr. McGregor was on his hands and knees planting out young cabbages, but he jumped up and ran after Peter, waving a rake and calling out, ""Stop thief.""",anger
"Peter gave himself up for lost, and shed big tears; but his sobs were overheard by some friendly sparrows, who flew to him in great excitement, and implored him to exert himself.",sadness
Peter began to cry.,sadness
"Then he tried to find his way straight across the garden, but he became more and more puzzled.",sadness
"He went back towards the toolshed, but suddenly, quite close to him, he heard the noise of a hoe-- scr-r-ritch, scratch, scratch, scritch.",surprise
"He slipped underneath the gate, and was safe at last in the wood outside the garden.",surprise
It was the second little jacket and pair of shoes that Peter had lost in a fortnight!,surprise
I am sorry to say that Peter was not very well during the evening.,sadness
"The eight little pigs had very fine appetites--""Yus, yus, yus! they eat and indeed they DO eat!"" said Aunt Pettitoes, looking at her family with pride.",joy
"And presently in a basket of clean clothes, we found another dirty little pig--""Tchut, tut, tut! whichever is this?"" grunted Aunt Pettitoes.",surprise
Cross-patch tried to bite me.,anger
"""Yus, yus!"" sighed Aunt Pettitoes.",anger
"""Yus, yus, yus,"" said Aunt Pettitoes, ""there will be more to eat without them.""",sadness

"Aunt Pettitoes sighed and grunted, and addressed those little pigs as follows--",sadness
"Pigling Bland who was a sedate little pig, looked solemnly at his mother, a tear trickled down his cheek.",sadness
"Aunt Pettitoes turned to the other--""Now son Alexander take the hand""--""Wee, wee, wee!"" giggled Alexander--""take the hand of your brother Pigling Bland, you must go to market.",joy
Pigling Bland listened gravely; Alexander was hopelessly volatile.,sadness
"He danced about and pinched his brother, singing--",joy
"""This pig went to market, this pig stayed at home, ""This pig had a bit of meat--",joy
Alexander went into squeals of laughter.,joy
"Then he pricked Pigling with the pin that had fastened his pig paper; and when Pigling slapped him he dropped the pin, and tried to take Pigling's pin, and the papers got mixed up.",anger
Pigling Bland reproved Alexander.,anger
"But presently they made it up again, and trotted away together, singing--",joy
"""To 2 1/2 oz. conversation sweeties at three farthings""--""What's this? this ain't a license?""",surprise
"To conclude the adventures of Alexander--the policeman sauntered up to the house about tea time, followed by a damp subdued little pig.",sadness

"Pigling Bland was shocked, there was little hope of sleeping in Market Town, and tomorrow was the hiring fair; it was deplorable to think how much time had been wasted by the frivolity of Alexander.",surprise
"He had never wanted to go; and the idea of standing all by himself in a crowded market, to be stared at, pushed, and hired by some big strange farmer was very disagreeable--",anger
"He put his cold hand in his pocket and felt his paper, he put his other hand in his other pocket and felt another paper--Alexander's!",surprise
"Pigling squealed; then ran back frantically, hoping to overtake Alexander and the policeman.",surprise
"He saw a small wooden hut, made his way to it, and crept inside --""I am afraid it IS a hen house, but what can I do?"" said Pigling Bland, wet and cold and quite tired out.",sadness
"""Bacon and eggs, bacon and eggs!"" clucked a hen on a perch.",joy
"""Trap, trap, trap! cackle, cackle, cackle!"" scolded the disturbed cockerel.",anger
"""To market, to market! jiggettyjig!"" clucked a broody white hen roosting next to him.",joy
"He made a singular remark--""Hallo, here's another!"" --seized Pigling by the scruff of the neck, and dropped him into the hamper.",surprise
"He looked up, blinking, and saw an offensively ugly elderly man, grinning from ear to ear.",joy
"There was a smothered noise--""Shut up!"" said Mr. Piperson.",anger
"Mr. Piperson pulled off the other boot and flung it after the first, there was again a curious noise-- ""Be quiet, will ye?"" said Mr. Piperson.",anger
"Mr. Piperson hurried out with the hamper, enjoining Pigling to shut the door behind him and not meddle with nought; or ""I'll come back and skin ye!"" said Mr. Piperson.",anger

A perfectly lovely little black Berkshire pig stood smiling beside him.,joy
"""Bacon, hams,"" replied Pig- wig cheerfully.",joy
"""Why on earth don't you run away?"" exclaimed the horrified Pigling.",surprise
"""I shall after supper,"" said Pig- wig decidedly.",joy
Pigling Bland made more porridge and watched her shyly.,joy
"I might take you to the bridge; if you have no objection,"" said Pigling much confused and sitting on the edge of his coppy stool.",sadness
Pig- wig's gratitude was such and she asked so many questions that it became embarrassing to Pigling Bland.,joy

The little Flopsy Bunnies slept delightfully in the warm sun.,joy
The little rabbits smiled sweetly in their sleep under the shower of grass; they did not awake because the lettuces had been so soporific.,joy
They dreamt that their mother Flopsy was tucking them up in a hay bed.,joy

"But the mother and both the sisters were frightened, and turned pale with anger as he took Ashputtel on his horse, and rode away with her.",anger
"Now this king and queen had plenty of money, and plenty of fine clothes to wear, and plenty of good things to eat and drink, and a coach to ride out in every day: but though they had been married many years they had no children, and this grieved them very much indeed.",sadness
"Then the queen took pity on the little fish, and threw it back again into the river; and before it swam away it lifted its head out of the water and said, ""I know what your wish is, and it shall be fulfilled, in return for your kindness to me--you will soon have a daughter.""",joy
"What the little fish had foretold soon came to pass; and the queen had a little girl, so very beautiful that the king could not cease looking on it for joy, and said he would hold a great feast and make merry, and show the child to all the land.",joy
"So twelve fairies came, each with a high red cap on her head, and red shoes with high heels on her feet, and a long white wand in her hand: and after the feast was over they gathered round in a ring and gave all their best gifts to the little princess.",joy

"Now, as she had not been asked to the feast she was very angry, and scolded the king and queen very much, and set to work to take her revenge.",anger
"So she cried out, ""The king""s daughter shall, in her fifteenth year, be wounded by a spindle, and fall down dead.""",anger
"Then the twelfth of the friendly fairies, who had not yet given her gift, came forward, and said that the evil wish must be fulfilled, but that she could soften its mischief; so her gift was, that the king""s daughter, when the spindle wounded her, should not really die, but should only fall asleep for a hundred years.",sadness
"In the door there was a golden key, and when she turned it the door sprang open, and there sat an old lady spinning away very busily.",surprise
"""Why, how now, good mother,"" said the princess; ""what are you doing there?""",surprise
"""How prettily that little thing turns round!"" said the princess, and took the spindle and began to try and spin.",joy
"But scarcely had she touched it, before the fairy""s prophecy was fulfilled; the spindle wounded her, and she fell down lifeless on the ground.",sadness
"However, she was not dead, but had only fallen into a deep sleep; and the king and the queen, who had just come home, and all their court, fell asleep too; and the horses slept in the stables, and the dogs in the court, the pigeons on the house-top, and the very flies slept upon the walls.",surprise
"Even the fire on the hearth left off blazing, and went to sleep; the jack stopped, and the spit that was turning about with a goose upon it for the king""s dinner stood still; and the cook, who was at that moment pulling the kitchen-boy by the hair to give him a box on the ear for something he had done amiss, let him go, and both fell asleep; the butler, who was slyly tasting the ale, fell asleep with the jug at his lips: and thus everything stood still, and slept soundly.",surprise
"This, however, none of them could ever do; for the thorns and bushes laid hold of them, as it were with hands; and there they stuck fast, and died wretchedly.",sadness
"Now that very day the hundred years were ended; and as the prince came to the thicket he saw nothing but beautiful flowering shrubs, through which he went with ease, and they shut in after him as thick as ever.",surprise
"She looked so beautiful that he could not take his eyes off her, so he stooped down and gave her a kiss.",joy
"But the moment he kissed her she opened her eyes and awoke, and smiled upon him; and they went out together; and soon the king and queen also awoke, and all the court, and gazed on each other with great wonder.",joy
"And the horses shook themselves, and the dogs jumped up and barked; the pigeons took their heads from under their wings, and looked about and flew into the fields; the flies on the walls buzzed again; the fire in the kitchen blazed up; round went the jack, and round went the spit, with the goose for the king""s dinner upon it; the butler finished his draught of ale; the maid went on plucking the fowl; and the cook gave the boy the box on his ear.",surprise
"And then the prince and Briar Rose were married, and the wedding feast was given; and they lived happily together all their lives long.",joy
"But this beautiful queen fell ill, and when she felt that her end drew near she called the king to her and said, ""Promise me that you will never marry again, unless you meet with a wife who is as beautiful as I am, and who has golden hair like mine.""",sadness
"Then when the king in his grief promised all she asked, she shut her eyes and died.",sadness
"But the king was not to be comforted, and for a long time never thought of taking another wife.",sadness
"At last, however, his wise men said, ""this will not do; the king must marry again, that we may have a queen.""",anger
"So the messengers came home, and had had all their trouble for nothing.",sadness
"She is the very image of my dead wife: unless I have her, I shall not find any bride upon the whole earth, and you say there must be a queen.""",anger
"When the courtiers heard this they were shocked, and said, ""Heaven forbid that a father should marry his daughter!",surprise
"Out of so great a sin no good can come.""",surprise
"And his daughter was also shocked, but hoped the king would soon give up such thoughts; so she said to him, ""Before I marry anyone I must have three dresses: one must be of gold, like the sun; another must be of shining silver, like the moon; and a third must be dazzling as the stars: besides this, I want a mantle of a thousand different kinds of fur put together, to which every beast in the kingdom must give a part of his skin.""",surprise
"""Look sharp!"" said the king to the huntsmen, ""and see what sort of game lies there.""",surprise
"And the huntsmen went up to the tree, and when they came back again said, ""In the hollow tree there lies a most wonderful beast, such as we never saw before; its skin seems to be of a thousand kinds of fur, but there it lies fast asleep.""",surprise
"""See,"" said the king, ""if you can catch it alive, and we will take it with us.""",joy
"Then they showed her a little corner under the staircase, where no light of day ever peeped in, and said, ""Cat-skin, you may lie and sleep there.""",sadness
Thus Cat-skin lived for a long time very sorrowfully.,sadness
"Everyone made way for her, for nobody knew her, and they thought she could be no less than a king""s daughter.",surprise
"But the king came up to her, and held out his hand and danced with her; and he thought in his heart, ""I never saw any one half so beautiful.""",joy
"When the dance was at an end she curtsied; and when the king looked round for her, she was gone, no one knew wither.",surprise
The guards that stood at the castle gate were called in: but they had seen no one.,surprise
"When she went into the kitchen to her work, and began to rake the ashes, the cook said, ""Let that alone till the morning, and heat the king""s soup; I should like to run up now and give a peep: but take care you don""t let a hair fall into it, or you will run a chance of never eating again.""",anger
"When the dance was over, the king ordered his soup to be brought in; and it pleased him so well, that he thought he had never tasted any so good before.",joy
"At the bottom he saw a gold ring lying; and as he could not make out how it had got there, he ordered the cook to be sent for.",surprise
"But the king said, ""That is not true; it was better done than you could do it.""",anger
"""I am a poor child,"" said she, ""that has lost both father and mother.""",sadness
"""I am good for nothing,"" said she, ""but to be scullion-girl, and to have boots and shoes thrown at my head.""",sadness
"""But how did you get the ring that was in the soup?"" asked the king.",surprise
"Then she ran to her little cabin, washed herself quickly, and took her dress out which was silvery as the moon, and put it on; and when she went in, looking like a king""s daughter, the king went up to her, and rejoiced at seeing her again, and when the dance began he danced with her.",joy
"Whilst the cook was above stairs, she got the golden necklace and dropped it into the soup; then it was brought to the king, who ate it, and it pleased him as well as before; so he sent for the cook, who was again forced to tell him that Cat-skin had cooked it.",joy
"Cat-skin was brought again before the king, but she still told him that she was only fit to have boots and shoes thrown at her head.",sadness
"""You must be a witch, Catskin,"" said the cook; ""for you always put something into your soup, so that it pleases the king better than mine.""",anger
"Then she put on her dress which sparkled like the stars, and went into the ball-room in it; and the king danced with her again, and thought she had never looked so beautiful as she did then.",joy
"When it was at an end, he would have held her fast by the hand, but she slipped away, and sprang so quickly through the crowd that he lost sight of her: and she ran as fast as she could into her little cabin under the stairs.",surprise
"When the king got to the bottom, he ordered Cat-skin to be called once more, and soon saw the white finger, and the ring that he had put on it whilst they were dancing: so he seized her hand, and kept fast hold of it, and when she wanted to loose herself and spring away, the fur cloak fell off a little on one side, and the starry dress sparkled underneath it.",surprise
"Then he got hold of the fur and tore it off, and her golden hair and beautiful form were seen, and she could no longer hide herself: so she washed the soot and ashes from her face, and showed herself to be the most beautiful princess upon the face of the earth.",surprise
"But the king said, ""You are my beloved bride, and we will never more be parted from each other.""",joy
"And the wedding feast was held, and a merry day it was, as ever was heard of or seen in that country, or indeed in any other.",joy
"A certain cat had made the acquaintance of a mouse, and had said so much to her about the great love and friendship she felt for her, that at length the mouse agreed that they should live and keep house together.",joy
"So the pot was placed in safety, but it was not long before the cat had a great yearning for it, and said to the mouse: ""I want to tell you something, little mouse; my cousin has brought a little son into the world, and has asked me to be godmother; he is white with brown spots, and I am to hold him over the font at the christening.",joy
"""Yes, yes,"" answered the mouse, ""by all means go, and if you get anything very good to eat, think of me.",joy
"All this, however, was untrue; the cat had no cousin, and had not been asked to be godmother.",surprise
"Then she took a walk upon the roofs of the town, looked out for opportunities, and then stretched herself in the sun, and licked her lips whenever she thought of the pot of fat, and not until it was evening did she return home.",joy
"""All went off well,"" answered the cat.",joy
"""Top off!"" said the cat quite coolly.",anger
"""Top off!"" cried the mouse, ""that is a very odd and uncommon name, is it a usual one in your family?""",surprise
"""What does that matter,"" said the cat, ""it is no worse than Crumb-stealer, as your godchildren are called.""",anger
Before long the cat was seized by another fit of yearning.,joy
"""Nothing ever seems so good as what one keeps to oneself,"" said she, and was quite satisfied with her day""s work.",joy
What are you saying?,surprise

"""All-gone,"" cried the mouse ""that is the most suspicious name of all!",surprise
I have never seen it in print.,surprise
"All-gone; what can that mean?"" and she shook her head, curled herself up, and lay down to sleep.",surprise
"From this time forth no one invited the cat to be godmother, but when the winter had come and there was no longer anything to be found outside, the mouse thought of their provision, and said: ""Come, cat, we will go to our pot of fat which we have stored up for ourselves--we shall enjoy that.""",joy
"""Yes,"" answered the cat, ""you will enjoy it as much as you would enjoy sticking that dainty tongue of yours out of the window.""",anger
"""Alas!"" said the mouse, ""now I see what has happened, now it comes to light!",surprise
You a true friend!,surprise
You have devoured all when you were standing godmother.,sadness
"First top off, then half-done, then--"" ""Will you hold your tongue,"" cried the cat, ""one word more, and I will eat you too.""",anger
"""All-gone"" was already on the poor mouse""s lips; scarcely had she spoken it before the cat sprang on her, seized her, and swallowed her down.",anger
"When she was below she fetched herself a chair, and set it before the barrel so that she had no need to stoop, and did not hurt her back or do herself any unexpected injury.",joy

"Then said the mother likewise: ""What a clever Elsie we have!"" and sat down and wept with them.",sadness
"The man upstairs waited a short time, but as his wife did not come back and his thirst grew ever greater, he said: ""I must go into the cellar myself and see where Elsie is.""",anger

"When he got down, the five of them were sitting screaming and lamenting quite piteously, each outdoing the other.",sadness
"""Ah, dear Hans,"" said Elsie, ""if we marry each other and have a child, and he is big, and we perhaps send him here to draw something to drink, then the pick-axe which has been left up there might dash his brains out if it were to fall down, so have we not reason to weep?""",sadness
"""Come,"" said Hans, ""more understanding than that is not needed for my household, as you are such a clever Elsie, I will have you,"" and seized her hand, took her upstairs with him, and married her.",joy

"Let Hansel be fat or lean, tomorrow I will kill him, and cook him.""",joy
"Ah, how the poor little sister did lament when she had to fetch the water, and how her tears did flow down her cheeks!",sadness
"""Dear God, do help us,"" she cried.",sadness
"""If the wild beasts in the forest had but devoured us, we should at any rate have died together.""",sadness
"""Just keep your noise to yourself,"" said the old woman, ""it won""t help you at all.""",anger
"And once Gretel was inside, she intended to shut the oven and let her bake in it, and then she would eat her, too.",joy
"""Silly goose,"" said the old woman.",anger
"""The door is big enough; just look, I can get in myself!"" and she crept up and thrust her head into the oven.",anger

Then Hansel sprang like a bird from its cage when the door is opened.,joy

"And as they had no longer any need to fear her, they went into the witch""s house, and in every corner there stood chests full of pearls and jewels.",surprise
"""These are far better than pebbles!"" said Hansel, and thrust into his pockets whatever could be got in, and Gretel said: ""I, too, will take something home with me,"" and filled her pinafore full.",surprise
"""We cannot cross,"" said Hansel, ""I see no foot-plank, and no bridge.""",sadness
"""And there is also no ferry,"" answered Gretel, ""but a white duck is swimming there: if I ask her, she will help us over.""",joy
"The duck came to them, and Hansel seated himself on its back, and told his sister to sit by him.",joy
"The good little duck did so, and when they were once safely across and had walked for a short time, the forest seemed to be more and more familiar to them, and at length they saw from afar their father""s house.",joy
"Then they began to run, rushed into the parlour, and threw themselves round their father""s neck.",joy
"The man had not known one happy hour since he had left the children in the forest; the woman, however, was dead.",joy
"Gretel emptied her pinafore until pearls and precious stones ran about the room, and Hansel threw one handful after another out of his pocket to add to them.",surprise
"Then all anxiety was at an end, and they lived together in perfect happiness.",joy
"My tale is done, there runs a mouse; whosoever catches it, may make himself a big fur cap out of it.",joy
"At last he said, ""Master, my time is up; I must go home and see my poor mother once more: so pray pay me my wages and let me go.""",sadness

"""Ah!"" said Hans aloud, ""what a fine thing it is to ride on horseback!",surprise

"Hans did not speak so softly but the horseman heard it all, and said, ""Well, friend, why do you go on foot then?""",surprise
"""Ah!"" said he, ""I have this load to carry: to be sure it is silver, but it is so heavy that I can""t hold up my head, and you must know it hurts my shoulder sadly.""",anger
"""With all my heart,"" said Hans: ""but as you are so kind to me, I must tell you one thing--you will have a weary task to draw that silver about with you.""",surprise
"Hans was delighted as he sat on the horse, drew himself up, squared his elbows, turned out his toes, cracked his whip, and rode merrily off, one minute whistling a merry tune, and another singing,",joy
"""No care and no sorrow, A fig for the morrow!",joy
"We""ll laugh and be merry, Sing neigh down derry!""",joy
"Away went the horse full gallop; and before Hans knew what he was about, he was thrown off, and lay on his back by the road-side.",surprise
"His horse would have ran off, if a shepherd who was coming by, driving a cow, had not stopped it.",joy
"Hans soon came to himself, and got upon his legs again, sadly vexed, and said to the shepherd, ""This riding is no joke, when a man has the luck to get upon a beast like this that stumbles and flings him off as if it would break his neck.",sadness
"However, I""m off now once for all: I like your cow now a great deal better than this smart beast that played me this trick, and has spoiled my best coat, you see, in this puddle; which, by the by, smells not very like a nosegay.",anger
"What would I give to have such a prize!""",joy
"""Well,"" said the shepherd, ""if you are so fond of her, I will change my cow for your horse; I like to do good to my neighbours, even though I lose by it myself.""",joy
"""Done!"" said Hans, merrily.",surprise
"""What a noble heart that good man has!"" thought he.",joy
"Then the shepherd jumped upon the horse, wished Hans and the cow good morning, and away he rode.",joy
"Hans brushed his coat, wiped his face and hands, rested a while, and then drove off his cow quietly, and thought his bargain a very lucky one.",joy
"""If I have only a piece of bread (and I certainly shall always be able to get that), I can, whenever I like, eat my butter and cheese with it; and when I am thirsty I can milk my cow and drink the milk: and what can I wish for more?""",joy
"But the heat grew greater as soon as noon came on, till at last, as he found himself on a wide heath that would take him more than an hour to cross, he began to be so hot and parched that his tongue clave to the roof of his mouth.",anger
"""I can find a cure for this,"" thought he; ""now I will milk my cow and quench my thirst"": so he tied her to the stump of a tree, and held his leathern cap to milk into; but not a drop was to be had.",sadness
"Who would have thought that this cow, which was to bring him milk and butter and cheese, was all that time utterly dry?",sadness
Hans had not thought of looking to that.,surprise
"While he was trying his luck in milking, and managing the matter very clumsily, the uneasy beast began to think him very troublesome; and at last gave him such a kick on the head as knocked him down; and there he lay a long while senseless.",surprise
"Luckily a butcher soon came by, driving a pig in a wheelbarrow.",joy
"""What is the matter with you, my man?"" said the butcher, as he helped him up.",surprise
"Hans told him what had happened, how he was dry, and wanted to milk his cow, but found the cow was dry too.",sadness
"Then the butcher gave him a flask of ale, saying, ""There, drink and refresh yourself; your cow will give you no milk: don""t you see she is an old beast, good for nothing but the slaughter-house?""",surprise
"""Alas, alas!"" said Hans, ""who would have thought it?",anger
"What a shame to take my horse, and give me only a dry cow!",anger
"If I kill her, what will she be good for?",sadness
I hate cow-beef; it is not tender enough for me.,anger
"If it were a pig now --like that fat gentleman you are driving along at his ease--one could do something with it; it would at any rate make sausages.""",sadness
"""Well,"" said the butcher, ""I don""t like to say no, when one is asked to do a kind, neighbourly thing.",joy
"To please you I will change, and give you my fine fat pig for the cow.""",joy
"""Heaven reward you for your kindness and self-denial!"" said Hans, as he gave the butcher the cow; and taking the pig off the wheel-barrow, drove it away, holding it by the string that was tied to its leg.",joy
"So on he jogged, and all seemed now to go right with him: he had met with some misfortunes, to be sure; but he was now well repaid for all.",joy
How could it be otherwise with such a travelling companion as he had at last got?,joy
"The countryman stopped to ask what was o""clock; this led to further chat; and Hans told him all his luck, how he had so many good bargains, and how all the world went gay and smiling with him.",joy
"""Feel,"" said he, ""how heavy it is, and yet it is only eight weeks old.",joy
"Whoever roasts and eats it will find plenty of fat upon it, it has lived so well!""",joy
"Meantime the countryman began to look grave, and shook his head.",sadness
"""Hark ye!"" said he, ""my worthy friend, you seem a good sort of fellow, so I can""t help doing you a kind turn.",joy
The least they will do will be to throw you into the horse-pond.,sadness

"""Tis not everyone would do so much for you as that.",anger
"However, I will not be hard upon you, as you are in trouble.""",joy
"Then he took the string in his hand, and drove off the pig by a side path; while Hans went on the way homewards free from care.",joy
"""After all,"" thought he, ""that chap is pretty well taken in.",joy
"I don""t care whose pig it is, but wherever it came from it has been a very good friend to me.",joy
I have much the best of the bargain.,joy
First there will be a capital roast; then the fat will find me in goose-grease for six months; and then there are all the beautiful white feathers.,joy
"I will put them into my pillow, and then I am sure I shall sleep soundly without rocking.",joy
How happy my mother will be!,joy
"Talk of a pig, indeed!",joy
"Give me a fine fat goose.""",joy
"""O""er hill and o""er dale So happy I roam, Work light and live well, All the world is my home; Then who so blythe, so merry as I?""",joy
"Hans stood looking on for a while, and at last said, ""You must be well off, master grinder! you seem so happy at your work.""",joy

"Hans took the stone, and went his way with a light heart: his eyes sparkled for joy, and he said to himself, ""Surely I must have been born in a lucky hour; everything I could want or wish for comes of itself.",joy
"People are so kind; they seem really to think I do them a favour in letting them make me rich, and giving me good bargains.""",joy
"At last he could go no farther, for the stone tired him sadly: and he dragged himself to the side of a river, that he might take a drink of water, and rest a while.",sadness
"So he laid the stone carefully by his side on the bank: but, as he stooped down to drink, he forgot it, pushed it a little, and down it rolled, plump into the stream.",surprise
"For a while he watched it sinking in the deep clear water; then sprang up and danced for joy, and again fell upon his knees and thanked Heaven, with tears in his eyes, for its kindness in taking away his only plague, the ugly heavy stone.",joy
"""How happy am I!"" cried he; ""nobody was ever so lucky as I.""",joy
"Then up he got with a light heart, free from all his troubles, and walked on till he reached his mother""s house, and told her how very easy the road to good luck was.",joy
"The huntsman replied: ""Lord, I will venture it at my own risk, of fear I know nothing.""",anger
"When they could see to the bottom there lay a wild man whose body was brown like rusty iron, and whose hair hung over his face down to his knees.",anger
"There was great astonishment over the wild man; the king, however, had him put in an iron cage in his courtyard, and forbade the door to be opened on pain of death, and the queen herself was to take the key into her keeping.",surprise
And from this time forth everyone could again go into the forest with safety.,joy
"The king had a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard, and while he was playing, his golden ball fell into the cage.",sadness
"The boy ran thither and said: ""Give me my ball out.""",anger
"""Not till you have opened the door for me,"" answered the man.",anger
"""No,"" said the boy, ""I will not do that; the king has forbidden it,"" and ran away.",anger
"On the third day the king had ridden out hunting, and the boy went once more and said: ""I cannot open the door even if I wished, for I have not the key.""",sadness
"The boy, who wanted to have his ball back, cast all thought to the winds, and brought the key.",sadness
"The door opened with difficulty, and the boy pinched his fingers.",sadness
"When it was open the wild man stepped out, gave him the golden ball, and hurried away.",joy
"When the king came home, he observed the empty cage, and asked the queen how that had happened.",anger
"She knew nothing about it, and sought the key, but it was gone.",surprise
"Then he could easily guess what had happened, and much grief reigned in the royal court.",sadness
"When the wild man had once more reached the dark forest, he took the boy down from his shoulder, and said to him: ""You will never see your father and mother again, but I will keep you with me, for you have set me free, and I have compassion on you.",sadness
"If you do all I bid you, you shall fare well.",joy
"Of treasure and gold have I enough, and more than anyone in the world.""",joy
"As he was thus sitting, his finger hurt him so violently that he involuntarily put it in the water.",sadness
"In the evening Iron Hans came back, looked at the boy, and said: ""What has happened to the well?""",anger
"But he said: ""You have dipped your finger into the water, this time it may pass, but take care you do not again let anything go in.""",anger
"Iron Hans came, and already knew what had happened.",anger
"""You have let a hair fall into the well,"" said he.",anger
"""I will allow you to watch by it once more, but if this happens for the third time then the well is polluted and you can no longer remain with me.""",anger
"But the time was long to him, and he looked at the reflection of his face on the surface of the water.",sadness
"And as he still bent down more and more while he was doing so, and trying to look straight into the eyes, his long hair fell down from his shoulders into the water.",surprise
"He raised himself up quickly, but the whole of the hair of his head was already golden and shone like the sun.",surprise
"When he came he already knew everything, and said: ""Take the handkerchief off.""",anger
"Then the golden hair streamed forth, and let the boy excuse himself as he might, it was of no use.",sadness
"""You have not stood the trial and can stay here no longer.",anger
"Go forth into the world, there you will learn what poverty is.",anger
"But as you have not a bad heart, and as I mean well by you, there is one thing I will grant you; if you fall into any difficulty, come to the forest and cry: ""Iron Hans,"" and then I will come and help you.",sadness
"There he looked for work, but could find none, and he learnt nothing by which he could help himself.",sadness
"The people about court did not at all know what use they could make of him, but they liked him, and told him to stay.",surprise
"Such a thing as that had never yet come under the king""s notice, and he said: ""When you come to the royal table you must take your hat off.""",anger
"Then the king had the cook called before him and scolded him, and asked how he could take such a boy as that into his service; and that he was to send him away at once.",anger
"The cook, however, had pity on him, and exchanged him for the gardener""s boy.",sadness
"And now the boy had to plant and water the garden, hoe and dig, and bear the wind and bad weather.",sadness
"As the sun shone on his hair it glittered and flashed so that the rays fell into the bedroom of the king""s daughter, and up she sprang to see what that could be.",surprise
"Then she saw the boy, and cried to him: ""Boy, bring me a wreath of flowers.""",surprise
"When he was ascending the stairs with them, the gardener met him, and said: ""How can you take the king""s daughter a garland of such common flowers?",anger
"Go quickly, and get another, and seek out the prettiest and rarest.""",anger
"""Oh, no,"" replied the boy, ""the wild ones have more scent, and will please her better.""",anger
"She, however, caught at his cap and pulled it off, and then his golden hair rolled down on his shoulders, and it was splendid to behold.",surprise
"He wanted to run out, but she held him by the arm, and gave him a handful of ducats.",surprise
"He took them to the gardener, and said: ""I present them to your children, they can play with them.""",joy
"The following day the king""s daughter again called to him that he was to bring her a wreath of field-flowers, and then he went in with it, she instantly snatched at his cap, and wanted to take it away from him, but he held it fast with both hands.",surprise
"On the third day things went just the same; she could not get his cap away from him, and he would not have her money.",anger
"Then said the gardener""s boy: ""I am grown up, and will go to the wars also, only give me a horse.""",anger
"The others laughed, and said: ""Seek one for yourself when we are gone, we will leave one behind us in the stable for you.""",surprise
"When they had gone forth, he went into the stable, and led the horse out; it was lame of one foot, and limped hobblety jib, hobblety jib; nevertheless he mounted it, and rode away to the dark forest.",anger
"""That you shall have, and still more than you ask for.""",joy
"Then the wild man went back into the forest, and it was not long before a stable-boy came out of it, who led a horse that snorted with its nostrils, and could hardly be restrained, and behind them followed a great troop of warriors entirely equipped in iron, and their swords flashed in the sun.",joy
"The youth made over his three-legged horse to the stable-boy, mounted the other, and rode at the head of the soldiers.",joy
"When he got near the battlefield a great part of the king""s men had already fallen, and little was wanting to make the rest give way.",sadness
"Then the youth galloped thither with his iron soldiers, broke like a hurricane over the enemy, and beat down all who opposed him.",anger
"They began to flee, but the youth pursued, and never stopped, until there was not a single man left.",joy
"Instead of returning to the king, however, he conducted his troop by byways back to the forest, and called forth Iron Hans.",joy
"All that he asked was done, and soon he was riding on his three-legged horse.",joy
"When the king returned to his palace, his daughter went to meet him, and wished him joy of his victory.",joy
"The daughter wanted to hear who the strange knight was, but the king did not know, and said: ""He followed the enemy, and I did not see him again.""",surprise
"She inquired of the gardener where his boy was, but he smiled, and said: ""He has just come home on his threelegged horse, and the others have been mocking him, and crying: ""Here comes our hobblety jib back again!""",surprise
"So he said: ""I did the best of all, and it would have gone badly without me.""",anger
"And then he was still more ridiculed.""",anger
"When the feast was announced, the youth went out to the forest, and called Iron Hans.",joy
"""That I may catch the king""s daughter""s golden apple.""",joy
"""It is as safe as if you had it already,"" said Iron Hans.",joy
"""You shall likewise have a suit of red armour for the occasion, and ride on a spirited chestnut-horse.""",joy
"When the day came, the youth galloped to the spot, took his place amongst the knights, and was recognized by no one.",joy
"The king""s daughter came forward, and threw a golden apple to the knights, but none of them caught it but he, only as soon as he had it he galloped away.",joy
"Again he was the only one who caught the apple, and he did not linger an instant, but galloped off with it.",joy
"The king grew angry, and said: ""That is not allowed; he must appear before me and tell his name.""",anger
"He gave the order that if the knight who caught the apple, should go away again they should pursue him, and if he would not come back willingly, they were to cut him down and stab him.",anger
"On the third day, he received from Iron Hans a suit of black armour and a black horse, and again he caught the apple.",joy
"But when he was riding off with it, the king""s attendants pursued him, and one of them got so near him that he wounded the youth""s leg with the point of his sword.",anger
"The youth nevertheless escaped from them, but his horse leapt so violently that the helmet fell from the youth""s head, and they could see that he had golden hair.",joy
"""He is at work in the garden; the queer creature has been at the festival too, and only came home yesterday evening; he has likewise shown my children three golden apples which he has won.""",joy
"But the king""s daughter went up to him and took it off, and then his golden hair fell down over his shoulders, and he was so handsome that all were amazed.",joy
"""Are you the knight who came every day to the festival, always in different colours, and who caught the three golden apples?"" asked the king.",surprise
"""Yes,"" answered he, ""and here the apples are,"" and he took them out of his pocket, and returned them to the king.",joy
"But I am likewise the knight who helped you to your victory over your enemies.""",joy
"""If you can perform such deeds as that, you are no gardener""s boy; tell me, who is your father?""",surprise
"""My father is a mighty king, and gold have I in plenty as great as I require.""",joy
"""I well see,"" said the king, ""that I owe my thanks to you; can I do anything to please you?""",surprise
"""Yes,"" answered he, ""that indeed you can.",joy
"The maiden laughed, and said: ""He does not stand much on ceremony, but I have already seen by his golden hair that he was no gardener""s boy,"" and then she went and kissed him.",joy
"His father and mother came to the wedding, and were in great delight, for they had given up all hope of ever seeing their dear son again.",joy
"And as they were sitting at the marriage-feast, the music suddenly stopped, the doors opened, and a stately king came in with a great retinue.",surprise
"He went up to the youth, embraced him and said: ""I am Iron Hans, and was by enchantment a wild man, but you have set me free; all the treasures which I possess, shall be your property.""",joy
"When any young man came within a hundred paces of her castle, he became quite fixed, and could not move a step till she came and set him free; which she would not do till he had given her his word never to come there again: but when any pretty maiden came within that space she was changed into a bird, and the fairy put her into a cage, and hung her up in a chamber in the castle.",anger
"She was prettier than all the pretty girls that ever were seen before, and a shepherd lad, whose name was Jorindel, was very fond of her, and they were soon to be married.",joy
"It was a beautiful evening; the last rays of the setting sun shone bright through the long stems of the trees upon the green underwood beneath, and the turtle-doves sang from the tall birches.",joy
"Jorinda sat down to gaze upon the sun; Jorindel sat by her side; and both felt sad, they knew not why; but it seemed as if they were to be parted from one another for ever.",sadness
"They had wandered a long way; and when they looked to see which way they should go home, they found themselves at a loss to know what path to take.",sadness
"The sun was setting fast, and already half of its circle had sunk behind the hill: Jorindel on a sudden looked behind him, and saw through the bushes that they had, without knowing it, sat down close under the old walls of the castle.",surprise
"""The ring-dove sang from the willow spray, Well-a-day!",joy
"He mourn""d for the fate of his darling mate, Well-a-day!""",sadness
"Jorindel turned to see the reason, and beheld his Jorinda changed into a nightingale, so that her song ended with a mournful /jug, jug/.",surprise
"And now the sun went quite down; the gloomy night came; the owl flew into a bush; and a moment after the old fairy came forth pale and meagre, with staring eyes, and a nose and chin that almost met one another.",anger
"She mumbled something to herself, seized the nightingale, and went away with it in her hand.",anger
Poor Jorindel saw the nightingale was gone-- but what could he do?,sadness
"""Till the prisoner is fast, And her doom is cast, There stay!",anger
"Oh, stay!",anger
"When the charm is around her, And the spell has bound her, Hie away! away!""",anger
On a sudden Jorindel found himself free.,surprise
"He prayed, he wept, he sorrowed, but all in vain.",sadness
"He could not go back to his own home, so he went to a strange village, and employed himself in keeping sheep.",sadness
"Many a time did he walk round and round as near to the hated castle as he dared go, but all in vain; he heard or saw nothing of Jorinda.",sadness
"At last he dreamt one night that he found a beautiful purple flower, and that in the middle of it lay a costly pearl; and he dreamt that he plucked the flower, and went with it in his hand into the castle, and that everything he touched with it was disenchanted, and that there he found his Jorinda again.",surprise
"In the morning when he awoke, he began to search over hill and dale for this pretty flower; and eight long days he sought for it in vain: but on the ninth day, early in the morning, he found the beautiful purple flower; and in the middle of it was a large dewdrop, as big as a costly pearl.",joy
"He walked nearer than a hundred paces to it, and yet he did not become fixed as before, but found that he could go quite close up to the door.",surprise
Jorindel was very glad indeed to see this.,joy
"Then he touched the door with the flower, and it sprang open; so that he went in through the court, and listened when he heard so many birds singing.",surprise
"When she saw Jorindel she was very angry, and screamed with rage; but she could not come within two yards of him, for the flower he held in his hand was his safeguard.",anger
"He ran or flew after her, touched the cage with the flower, and Jorinda stood before him, and threw her arms round his neck looking as beautiful as ever, as beautiful as when they walked together in the wood.",joy
"Then he touched all the other birds with the flower, so that they all took their old forms again; and he took Jorinda home, where they were married, and lived happily together many years: and so did a good many other lads, whose maidens had been forced to sing in the old fairy""s cages by themselves, much longer than they liked.",joy
"A great king of a land far away in the East had a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited, that none of the princes who came to ask her in marriage was good enough for her, and she only made sport of them.",anger
"Then the princess came in, and as she passed by them she had something spiteful to say to every one.",anger
"The first was too fat: ""He""s as round as a tub,"" said she.",anger
"The next was too tall: ""What a maypole!"" said she.",anger
"The next was too short: ""What a dumpling!"" said she.",anger
"The fourth was too pale, and she called him ""Wallface.""",anger
"The fifth was too red, so she called him ""Coxcomb.""",anger
"The sixth was not straight enough; so she said he was like a green stick, that had been laid to dry over a baker""s oven.",anger
And thus she had some joke to crack upon every one: but she laughed more than all at a good king who was there.,anger
"""Look at him,"" said she; ""his beard is like an old mop; he shall be called Grisly-beard.""",anger
"But the old king was very angry when he saw how his daughter behaved, and how she ill-treated all his guests; and he vowed that, willing or unwilling, she should marry the first man, be he prince or beggar, that came to the door.",anger
"Then the king said, ""You have sung so well, that I will give you my daughter for your wife.""",joy
"So words and tears were of no avail; the parson was sent for, and she was married to the fiddler.",sadness
"When this was over the king said, ""Now get ready to go--you must not stay here--you must travel on with your husband.""",anger
"""It belongs to King Grisly-beard,"" answered he; ""hadst thou taken him, all had been thine.""",sadness
"""Ah! unlucky wretch that I am!"" sighed she; ""would that I had married King Grisly-beard!""",anger
"""Whose are these beautiful green meadows?"" said she.",surprise
"""They belong to King Grisly-beard, hadst thou taken him, they had all been thine.""",sadness
"""Ah! unlucky wretch that I am!"" said she; ""would that I had married King Grisly-beard!""",anger
"""Whose is this noble city?"" said she.",surprise
"""It belongs to King Grisly-beard; hadst thou taken him, it had all been thine.""",sadness
"""Ah! wretch that I am!"" sighed she; ""why did I not marry King Grisly-beard?""",anger
"""That is no business of mine,"" said the fiddler: ""why should you wish for another husband?",anger
"Am not I good enough for you?""",anger
"""What a paltry place!"" said she; ""to whom does that little dirty hole belong?""",surprise
"""What do we want with servants?"" said he; ""you must do for yourself whatever is to be done.",surprise
"Now make the fire, and put on water and cook my supper, for I am very tired.""",anger
"But the princess knew nothing of making fires and cooking, and the fiddler was forced to help her.",anger
When they had eaten a very scanty meal they went to bed; but the fiddler called her up very early in the morning to clean the house.,anger
"Thus they lived for two days: and when they had eaten up all there was in the cottage, the man said, ""Wife, we can""t go on thus, spending money and earning nothing.",anger
"You must learn to weave baskets.""",anger
"Then he went out and cut willows, and brought them home, and she began to weave; but it made her fingers very sore.",anger
"""I see this work won""t do,"" said he: ""try and spin; perhaps you will do that better.""",sadness
So she sat down and tried to spin; but the threads cut her tender fingers till the blood ran.,sadness
"""See now,"" said the fiddler, ""you are good for nothing; you can do no work: what a bargain I have got!",anger
"However, I""ll try and set up a trade in pots and pans, and you shall stand in the market and sell them.""",anger
"""Alas!"" sighed she, ""if any of my father""s court should pass by and see me standing in the market, how they will laugh at me!""",sadness
"But her husband did not care for that, and said she must work, if she did not wish to die of hunger.",anger
"At first the trade went well; for many people, seeing such a beautiful woman, went to buy her wares, and paid their money without thinking of taking away the goods.",joy
"They lived on this as long as it lasted; and then her husband bought a fresh lot of ware, and she sat herself down with it in the corner of the market; but a drunken soldier soon came by, and rode his horse against her stall, and broke all her goods into a thousand pieces.",sadness
"Then she began to cry, and knew not what to do.",sadness
"""Who would have thought you would have been so silly,"" said he, ""as to put an earthenware stall in the corner of the market, where everybody passes? but let us have no more crying; I see you are not fit for this sort of work, so I have been to the king""s palace, and asked if they did not want a kitchen-maid; and they say they will take you, and there you will have plenty to eat.""",anger
"Thus the princess became a kitchen-maid, and helped the cook to do all the dirtiest work; but she was allowed to carry home some of the meat that was left, and on this they lived.",sadness
"She had not been there long before she heard that the king""s eldest son was passing by, going to be married; and she went to one of the windows and looked out.",surprise
"Everything was ready, and all the pomp and brightness of the court was there.",joy
Then she bitterly grieved for the pride and folly which had brought her so low.,sadness
"And the servants gave her some of the rich meats, which she put into her basket to take home.",joy
"Then everybody laughed and jeered at her; and she was so abashed, that she wished herself a thousand feet deep in the earth.",sadness
I am the fiddler who has lived with you in the hut.,joy
I brought you there because I really loved you.,joy
I am also the soldier that overset your stall.,joy
"I have done all this only to cure you of your silly pride, and to show you the folly of your ill-treatment of me.",joy
"Now all is over: you have learnt wisdom, and it is time to hold our marriage feast.""",joy
"Then the chamberlains came and brought her the most beautiful robes; and her father and his whole court were there already, and welcomed her home on her marriage.",joy
Joy was in every face and every heart.,joy
The feast was grand; they danced and sang; all were merry; and I only wish that you and I had been of the party.,joy
"And when the time came for him to go home, he had bought pearls and jewels for the two eldest, but he had sought everywhere in vain for the rose; and when he went into any garden and asked for such a thing, the people laughed at him, and asked him whether he thought roses grew in snow.",sadness
"This grieved him very much, for Lily was his dearest child; and as he was journeying home, thinking what he should bring her, he came to a fine castle; and around the castle was a garden, in one half of which it seemed to be summer-time and in the other half winter.",sadness
"""A lucky hit!"" said he, as he called to his servant, and told him to go to a beautiful bed of roses that was there, and bring him away one of the finest flowers.",joy
"This done, they were riding away well pleased, when up sprang a fierce lion, and roared out, ""Whoever has stolen my roses shall be eaten up alive!""",anger
"""No!"" said the lion, ""nothing, unless you undertake to give me whatever meets you on your return home; if you agree to this, I will give you your life, and the rose too for your daughter.""",anger
"And at last the man yielded with a heavy heart, and took the rose; and said he would give the lion whatever should meet him first on his return.",sadness
"And as he came near home, it was Lily, his youngest and dearest daughter, that met him; she came running, and kissed him, and welcomed him home; and when she saw that he had brought her the rose, she was still more glad.",joy
"But her father began to be very sorrowful, and to weep, saying, ""Alas, my dearest child!",sadness
"I have bought this flower at a high price, for I have said I would give you to a wild lion; and when he has you, he will tear you in pieces, and eat you.""",sadness
"The next morning she asked the way she was to go, and took leave of her father, and went forth with a bold heart into the wood.",joy
But the lion was an enchanted prince.,surprise
"And when Lily came to the castle, he welcomed her so courteously that she agreed to marry him.",joy
"The wedding-feast was held, and they lived happily together a long time.",joy
"After some time he said to her, ""Tomorrow there will be a great feast in your father""s house, for your eldest sister is to be married; and if you wish to go and visit her my lions shall lead you thither.""",joy
"Then she rejoiced much at the thoughts of seeing her father once more, and set out with the lions; and everyone was overjoyed to see her, for they had thought her dead long since.",joy
"But she told them how happy she was, and stayed till the feast was over, and then went back to the wood.",joy
"However, she gave him no rest, and said she would take care no light should fall upon him.",anger
"In a moment he disappeared, and when his wife came in and looked for him, she found only a white dove; and it said to her, ""Seven years must I fly up and down over the face of the earth, but every now and then I will let fall a white feather, that will show you the way I am going; follow it, and at last you may overtake and set me free.""",sadness
"This said, he flew out at the door, and poor Lily followed; and every now and then a white feather fell, and showed her the way she was to journey.",sadness
"Thus she went roving on through the wide world, and looked neither to the right hand nor to the left, nor took any rest, for seven years.",sadness
"Then she began to be glad, and thought to herself that the time was fast coming when all her troubles should end; yet repose was still far off, for one day as she was travelling on she missed the white feather, and when she lifted up her eyes she could nowhere see the dove.",joy
"""Now,"" thought she to herself, ""no aid of man can be of use to me.""",sadness
"So she thanked the sun, and went on her way till eventide; and when the moon arose, she cried unto it, and said, ""Thou shinest through the night, over field and grove--hast thou nowhere seen my white dove?""",sadness
"Go to the Red Sea; on the right shore stand many rods--count them, and when thou comest to the eleventh, break it off, and smite the dragon with it; and so the lion will have the victory, and both of them will appear to you in their own forms.",joy
"Then look round and thou wilt see a griffin, winged like bird, sitting by the Red Sea; jump on to his back with thy beloved one as quickly as possible, and he will carry you over the waters to your home.",joy
"But no sooner was the princess released from the spell, than she seized the prince by the arm and sprang on to the griffin""s back, and went off carrying the prince away with her.",surprise
"Thus the unhappy traveller was again forsaken and forlorn; but she took heart and said, ""As far as the wind blows, and so long as the cock crows, I will journey on, till I find him once again.""",sadness
"So she put it on, and went into the palace, and all the people gazed upon her; and the dress pleased the bride so much that she asked whether it was to be sold.",joy
"Wilt thou then forget me quite?""",sadness
"Then poor Lily was led away, and forced to give up the golden dress; and when she saw that there was no help for her, she went out into a meadow, and sat herself down and wept.",sadness
"But as she sat she bethought herself of the egg that the moon had given her; and when she broke it, there ran out a hen and twelve chickens of pure gold, that played about, and then nestled under the old one""s wings, so as to form the most beautiful sight in the world.",joy
"And she rose up and drove them before her, till the bride saw them from her window, and was so pleased that she came forth and asked her if she would sell the brood.",joy
"Then the prince took care to throw away the sleeping draught; and when Lily came and began again to tell him what woes had befallen her, and how faithful and true to him she had been, he knew his beloved wife""s voice, and sprang up, and said, ""You have awakened me as from a dream, for the strange princess had thrown a spell around me, so that I had altogether forgotten you; but Heaven hath sent you to me in a lucky hour.""",joy
"There they found their child, now grown up to be comely and fair; and after all their troubles they lived happily together to the end of their days.",joy
"Once upon a time there was a dear little girl who was loved by everyone who looked at her, but most of all by her grandmother, and there was nothing that she would not have given to the child.",joy
"One day her mother said to her: ""Come, Little Red-Cap, here is a piece of cake and a bottle of wine; take them to your grandmother, she is ill and weak, and they will do her good.",sadness
"""I will take great care,"" said Little Red-Cap to her mother, and gave her hand on it.",joy
"Red-Cap did not know what a wicked creature he was, and was not at all afraid of him.",joy
"The wolf thought to himself: ""What a tender young creature! what a nice plump mouthful--she will be better to eat than the old woman.",joy
"I must act craftily, so as to catch both.""",joy
"I believe, too, that you do not hear how sweetly the little birds are singing; you walk gravely along as if you were going to school, while everything else out here in the wood is merry.""",joy
"It is so early in the day that I shall still get there in good time""; and so she ran from the path into the wood to look for flowers.",joy
"And whenever she had picked one, she fancied that she saw a still prettier one farther on, and ran after it, and so got deeper and deeper into the wood.",joy
"""Lift the latch,"" called out the grandmother, ""I am too weak, and cannot get up.""",sadness
"""Oh! grandmother,"" she said, ""what big ears you have!""",surprise
"""But, grandmother, what big eyes you have!"" she said.",surprise
"""But, grandmother, what large hands you have!""",surprise
"When the wolf had appeased his appetite, he lay down again in the bed, fell asleep and began to snore very loud.",joy
"""Do I find you here, you old sinner!"" said he.",surprise
"""I have long sought you!""",surprise
"Then just as he was going to fire at him, it occurred to him that the wolf might have devoured the grandmother, and that she might still be saved, so he did not fire, but took a pair of scissors, and began to cut open the stomach of the sleeping wolf.",surprise
"Red-Cap, however, quickly fetched great stones with which they filled the wolf""s belly, and when he awoke, he wanted to run away, but the stones were so heavy that he collapsed at once, and fell dead.",surprise
Then all three were delighted.,joy
"The huntsman drew off the wolf""s skin and went home with it; the grandmother ate the cake and drank the wine which Red-Cap had brought, and revived, but Red-Cap thought to herself: ""As long as I live, I will never by myself leave the path, to run into the wood, when my mother has forbidden me to do so.""",joy
"But Red-Cap went joyously home, and no one ever did anything to harm her again.",joy
"The mother, however, loved the ugly and lazy one best, because she was her own daughter, and so the other, who was only her stepdaughter, was made to do all the work of the house, and was quite the Cinderella of the family.",joy
"She ran home crying to tell of her misfortune, but her stepmother spoke harshly to her, and after giving her a violent scolding, said unkindly, ""As you have let the spindle fall into the well you may go yourself and fetch it out.""",sadness
Then she carefully gathered the apples together in a heap and walked on again.,joy
"The old woman spoke so kindly, that the girl summoned up courage and agreed to enter into her service.",joy
"The old woman was as good as her word: she never spoke angrily to her, and gave her roast and boiled meats every day.",joy
"So she stayed on with Mother Holle for some time, and then she began to grow unhappy.",sadness

"After waiting awhile, she went to Mother Holle and said, ""I am so homesick, that I cannot stay with you any longer, for although I am so happy here, I must return to my own people.""",sadness
"Then Mother Holle said, ""I am pleased that you should want to go back to your own people, and as you have served me so well and faithfully, I will take you home myself.""",joy
"Then she went in to her mother and sister, and as she was so richly covered with gold, they gave her a warm welcome.",joy
"She related to them all that had happened, and when the mother heard how she had come by her great riches, she thought she should like her ugly, lazy daughter to go and try her fortune.",joy
"But the lazy girl answered, ""Do you think I am going to dirty my hands for you?"" and walked on.",anger
"But she only answered, ""A nice thing to ask me to do, one of the apples might fall on my head,"" and passed on.",anger
"At last she came to Mother Holle""s house, and as she had heard all about the large teeth from her sister, she was not afraid of them, and engaged herself without delay to the old woman.",joy
"The first day she was very obedient and industrious, and exerted herself to please Mother Holle, for she thought of the gold she should get in return.",joy
"The next day, however, she began to dawdle over her work, and the third day she was more idle still; then she began to lie in bed in the mornings and refused to get up.",anger
"Worse still, she neglected to make the old woman""s bed properly, and forgot to shake it so that the feathers might fly about.",anger
"So Mother Holle very soon got tired of her, and told her she might go.",anger

"""That is in return for your services,"" said the old woman, and she shut the gate.",anger

"""But what can we do with him?"" said the shepherd, ""he has not a tooth in his head, and the thieves don""t care for him at all; to be sure he has served us, but then he did it to earn his livelihood; tomorrow shall be his last day, depend upon it.""",anger
The dog liked this plan very well; and accordingly so it was managed.,joy
"Then the shepherd patted him on the head, and said, ""Old Sultan has saved our child from the wolf, and therefore he shall live and be well taken care of, and have plenty to eat.",joy
So from this time forward Sultan had all that he could wish for.,joy
"""No,"" said the Sultan; ""I will be true to my master.""",anger
"Then the wolf was very angry, and called Sultan ""an old rogue,"" and swore he would have his revenge.",anger
So the next morning the wolf sent the boar to challenge Sultan to come into the wood to fight the matter.,anger
"Sultan and the cat soon came up, and looked about and wondered that no one was there.",surprise
"The boar, however, had not quite hidden himself, for his ears stuck out of the bush; and when he shook one of them a little, the cat, seeing something move, and thinking it was a mouse, sprang upon it, and bit and scratched it, so that the boar jumped up and grunted, and ran away, roaring out, ""Look up in the tree, there sits the one who is to blame.""",anger
"So they looked up, and espied the wolf sitting amongst the branches; and they called him a cowardly rascal, and would not suffer him to come down till he was heartily ashamed of himself, and had promised to be good friends again with old Sultan.",anger
At length the woman hoped that God was about to grant her desire.,sadness
"One day the woman was standing by this window and looking down into the garden, when she saw a bed which was planted with the most beautiful rampion (rapunzel), and it looked so fresh and green that she longed for it, she quite pined away, and began to look pale and miserable.",sadness
"""Ah,"" she replied, ""if I can""t eat some of the rampion, which is in the garden behind our house, I shall die.""",sadness

"""What do I hear you say!",anger
"I thought I had separated you from all the world, and yet you have deceived me!""",anger
"In her anger she clutched Rapunzel""s beautiful tresses, wrapped them twice round her left hand, seized a pair of scissors with the right, and snip, snap, they were cut off, and the lovely braids lay on the ground.",surprise

"The third brother met a huntsman, who took him with him, and taught him so well all that belonged to hunting, that he became very clever in the craft of the woods; and when he left his master he gave him a bow, and said, ""Whatever you shoot at with this bow you will be sure to hit.""",joy
"""Oh, no!"" said the young man; ""sitting cross-legged from morning to night, working backwards and forwards with a needle and goose, will never suit me.""",anger
"""Oh!"" answered the man, ""that is not my sort of tailoring; come with me, and you will learn quite another kind of craft from that.""",surprise

"Not long after this there was a great bustle in the country; for the king""s daughter had been carried off by a mighty dragon, and the king mourned over his loss day and night, and made it known that whoever brought her back to him should have her for a wife.",surprise

"""Then I will try my skill,"" said the thief, and went and stole her away from under the dragon, so quietly and gently that the beast did not know it, but went on snoring.",joy
Then away they hastened with her full of joy in their boat towards the ship; but soon came the dragon roaring behind them through the air; for he awoke and missed the princess.,surprise

"When they had brought home the princess to her father, there was great rejoicing; and he said to the four brothers, ""One of you shall marry her, but you must settle amongst yourselves which it is to be.""",joy

"""Your seeing her would have been of no use,"" said the thief, ""if I had not taken her away from the dragon; therefore she ought to be mine.""",anger
"""No, she is mine,"" said the huntsman; ""for if I had not killed the dragon, he would, after all, have torn you and the princess into pieces.""",anger

"Then the king put in a word, and said, ""Each of you is right; and as all cannot have the young lady, the best way is for neither of you to have her: for the truth is, there is somebody she likes a great deal better.",surprise

So the brothers agreed that this plan would be much better than either quarrelling or marrying a lady who had no mind to have them.,joy

Then he opened the door and turned him adrift.,anger

"When he came to the forest the little old grey man met him likewise, and greeting him, said: ""Give me a piece of your cake and a drink out of your bottle; I am so hungry and thirsty.""",sadness
"Dummling answered: ""I have only cinder-cake and sour beer; if that pleases you, we will sit down and eat.""",sadness
"So they sat down, and when Dummling pulled out his cinder-cake, it was a fine sweet cake, and the sour beer had become good wine.",surprise
"So they ate and drank, and after that the little man said: ""Since you have a good heart, and are willing to divide what you have, I will give you good luck.",joy
"Dummling went and cut down the tree, and when it fell there was a goose sitting in the roots with feathers of pure gold.",surprise
"He lifted her up, and taking her with him, went to an inn where he thought he would stay the night.",joy
"The eldest thought: ""I shall soon find an opportunity of pulling out a feather,"" and as soon as Dummling had gone out she seized the goose by the wing, but her finger and hand remained sticking fast to it.",surprise
"The second came soon afterwards, thinking only of how she might get a feather for herself, but she had scarcely touched her sister than she was held fast.",surprise
"At last the third also came with the like intent, and the others screamed out: ""Keep away; for goodness"" sake keep away!""",anger
But she did not understand why she was to keep away.,sadness
"""The others are there,"" she thought, ""I may as well be there too,"" and ran to them; but as soon as she had touched her sister, she remained sticking fast to her.",anger
So they had to spend the night with the goose.,anger
"In the middle of the fields the parson met them, and when he saw the procession he said: ""For shame, you good-for-nothing girls, why are you running across the fields after this young man?",anger
"Is that seemly?""",anger
"At the same time he seized the youngest by the hand in order to pull her away, but as soon as he touched her he likewise stuck fast, and was himself obliged to run behind.",surprise
"Before long the sexton came by and saw his master, the parson, running behind three girls.",surprise
"He was astonished at this and called out: ""Hi! your reverence, whither away so quickly?",surprise
"Do not forget that we have a christening today!"" and running after him he took him by the sleeve, but was also held fast to it.",surprise
"But they had scarcely touched the sexton when they were held fast, and now there were seven of them running behind Dummling and the goose.",surprise
"When Dummling heard this, he went with his goose and all her train before the king""s daughter, and as soon as she saw the seven people running on and on, one behind the other, she began to laugh quite loudly, and as if she would never stop.",joy
"Dummling thought of the little grey man, who could certainly help him; so he went into the forest, and in the same place where he had felled the tree, he saw a man sitting, who had a very sorrowful face.",surprise
"Dummling asked him what he was taking to heart so sorely, and he answered: ""I have such a great thirst and cannot quench it; cold water I cannot stand, a barrel of wine I have just emptied, but that to me is like a drop on a hot stone!""",sadness
"""There, I can help you,"" said Dummling, ""just come with me and you shall be satisfied.""",joy
"He led him into the king""s cellar, and the man bent over the huge barrels, and drank and drank till his loins hurt, and before the day was out he had emptied all the barrels.",joy
"Then Dummling asked once more for his bride, but the king was vexed that such an ugly fellow, whom everyone called Dummling, should take away his daughter, and he made a new condition; he must first find a man who could eat a whole mountain of bread.",anger
"Dummling did not think long, but went straight into the forest, where in the same place there sat a man who was tying up his body with a strap, and making an awful face, and saying: ""I have eaten a whole ovenful of rolls, but what good is that when one has such a hunger as I?",sadness
"My stomach remains empty, and I must tie myself up if I am not to die of hunger.""",sadness
"At this Dummling was glad, and said: ""Get up and come with me; you shall eat yourself full.""",joy
"The man from the forest stood before it, began to eat, and by the end of one day the whole mountain had vanished.",joy
"Then Dummling for the third time asked for his bride; but the king again sought a way out, and ordered a ship which could sail on land and on water.",anger
"""As soon as you come sailing back in it,"" said he, ""you shall have my daughter for wife.""",anger
"Dummling went straight into the forest, and there sat the little grey man to whom he had given his cake.",surprise
"When he heard what Dummling wanted, he said: ""Since you have given me to eat and to drink, I will give you the ship; and I do all this because you once were kind to me.""",joy
"Then he gave him the ship which could sail on land and water, and when the king saw that, he could no longer prevent him from having his daughter.",anger
"The wedding was celebrated, and after the king""s death, Dummling inherited his kingdom and lived for a long time contentedly with his wife.",joy
"They loved each other dearly, but sorrowed much that they had no children.",sadness
"So greatly did they desire to have one, that the wife prayed for it day and night, but still they remained childless.",sadness
"""Ah,"" sighed the woman heavily, ""if I had but a child, as red as blood and as white as snow,"" and as she spoke the words, her heart grew light within her, and it seemed to her that her wish was granted, and she returned to the house feeling glad and comforted.",joy
"Once again the wife stood under the juniper-tree, and it was so full of sweet scent that her heart leaped for joy, and she was so overcome with her happiness, that she fell on her knees.",joy
"Presently the fruit became round and firm, and she was glad and at peace; but when they were fully ripe she picked the berries and ate eagerly of them, and then she grew sad and ill.",sadness
"A little while later she called her husband, and said to him, weeping.",sadness
"""If I die, bury me under the juniper-tree.""",sadness
"Then she felt comforted and happy again, and before another month had passed she had a little child, and when she saw that it was as white as snow and as red as blood, her joy was so great that she died.",joy
"Her husband buried her under the juniper-tree, and wept bitterly for her.",sadness
"By degrees, however, his sorrow grew less, and although at times he still grieved over his loss, he was able to go about as usual, and later on he married again.",sadness
"He now had a little daughter born to him; the child of his first wife was a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow.",joy
"The mother loved her daughter very much, and when she looked at her and then looked at the boy, it pierced her heart to think that he would always stand in the way of her own child, and she was continually thinking how she could get the whole of the property for her.",anger
"This evil thought took possession of her more and more, and made her behave very unkindly to the boy.",anger
"""Mother,"" said the little daughter again, ""may not brother have one too?""",surprise
"The mother was angry at this, but she answered, ""Yes, when he comes out of school.""",anger
"Just then she looked out of the window and saw him coming, and it seemed as if an evil spirit entered into her, for she snatched the apple out of her little daughter""s hand, and said, ""You shall not have one before your brother.""",anger
She threw the apple into the chest and shut it to.,anger
"The little boy now came in, and the evil spirit in the wife made her say kindly to him, ""My son, will you have an apple?"" but she gave him a wicked look.",anger
The thought came to her that she would kill him.,anger
"And as he bent over to do so, the evil spirit urged her, and crash! down went the lid, and off went the little boy""s head.",surprise
"So little Marleen went, and said, ""Brother, give me that apple,"" but he did not say a word; then she gave him a box on the ear, and his head rolled off.",surprise
"""Oh!"" she said, ""I have knocked off brother""s head,"" and then she wept and wept, and nothing would stop her.",sadness
"""What have you done!"" said her mother, ""but no one must know about it, so you must keep silence; what is done can""t be undone; we will make him into puddings.""",anger
"But Marleen stood looking on, and wept and wept, and her tears fell into the pot, so that there was no need of salt.",sadness
"Presently the father came home and sat down to his dinner; he asked, ""Where is my son?""",surprise
"The mother said nothing, but gave him a large dish of black pudding, and Marleen still wept without ceasing.",sadness
"""What has he gone there for, and he never even said goodbye to me!""",anger
"""I feel very unhappy about it,"" said the husband, ""in case it should not be all right, and he ought to have said goodbye to me.""",sadness
"With this he went on with his dinner, and said, ""Little Marleen, why do you weep?",surprise
"Little Marleen went upstairs and took her best silk handkerchief out of her bottom drawer, and in it she wrapped all the bones from under the table and carried them outside, and all the time she did nothing but weep.",sadness
"Then she laid them in the green grass under the junipertree, and she had no sooner done so, then all her sadness seemed to leave her, and she wept no more.",joy
"And now the juniper-tree began to move, and the branches waved backwards and forwards, first away from one another, and then together again, as it might be someone clapping their hands for joy.",surprise
"After this a mist came round the tree, and in the midst of it there was a burning as of fire, and out of the fire there flew a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently, and when it could no more be seen, the juniper-tree stood there as before, and the silk handkerchief and the bones were gone.",surprise
"Little Marleen now felt as lighthearted and happy as if her brother were still alive, and she went back to the house and sat down cheerfully to the table and ate.",joy
"""My mother killed her little son; My father grieved when I was gone; My sister loved me best of all; She laid her kerchief over me, And took my bones that they might lie Underneath the juniper-tree Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!""",joy

"But he ran on into the middle of the street, with a slipper on one foot and a sock on the other; he still had on his apron, and still held the gold chain and the pincers in his hands, and so he stood gazing up at the bird, while the sun came shining brightly down on the street.",joy
"""Bird,"" he said, ""how beautifully you sing!",joy
"""Only sing me that again.""",sadness
"The bird flew down and took the gold chain in his right claw, and then he alighted again in front of the goldsmith and sang:",joy

"The shoemaker heard him, and he jumped up and ran out in his shirtsleeves, and stood looking up at the bird on the roof with his hand over his eyes to keep himself from being blinded by the sun.",surprise
"""Bird,"" he said, ""how beautifully you sing!""",joy
"Then he called through the door to his wife: ""Wife, come out; here is a bird, come and look at it and hear how beautifully it sings.""",joy
"Then he called his daughter and the children, then the apprentices, girls and boys, and they all ran up the street to look at the bird, and saw how splendid it was with its red and green feathers, and its neck like burnished gold, and eyes like two bright stars in its head.",joy
"""My mother killed her little son; My father grieved when I was gone; My sister loved me best of all; She laid her kerchief over me, And took my bones that they might lie Underneath the juniper-tree Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!""",joy
"two more men left off and listened,",surprise
"then four more left off,",surprise
"Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!""",joy
then he looked up and the last one had left off work.,surprise
"""Bird,"" he said, ""what a beautiful song that is you sing!",joy

"And when he had finished his song, he spread his wings, and with the chain in his right claw, the shoes in his left, and the millstone round his neck, he flew right away to his father""s house.",joy
"""How lighthearted I feel,"" said the father, ""so pleased and cheerful.""",joy
But little Marleen sat and wept and wept.,sadness
"""I do feel so happy,"" said the father, ""and how beautifully the sun shines; I feel just as if I were going to see an old friend again.""",joy
"""Look, mother,"" said the man, ""at the beautiful bird that is singing so magnificently; and how warm and bright the sun is, and what a delicious scent of spice in the air!""",joy
My sister loved me best of all;,joy
then little Marleen laid her head down on her knees and sobbed.,sadness
"""I must go outside and see the bird nearer,"" said the man.",joy
"She laid her kerchief over me, And took my bones that they might lie Underneath the juniper-tree Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!""",joy

My sister loved me best of all;,joy
"Underneath the juniper-tree Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!""",joy
And she now felt quite happy and lighthearted; she put on the shoes and danced and jumped about in them.,joy
"""I was so miserable,"" she said, ""when I came out, but that has all passed away; that is indeed a splendid bird, and he has given me a pair of red shoes.""",joy
"But as she crossed the threshold, crash! the bird threw the millstone down on her head, and she was crushed to death.",surprise
"The father and little Marleen heard the sound and ran out, but they only saw mist and flame and fire rising from the spot, and when these had passed, there stood the little brother, and he took the father and little Marleen by the hand; then they all three rejoiced, and went inside together and sat down to their dinners and ate.",joy
"One day, as he was roaming along in a brown study, thinking with no great comfort on what he had been and what he now was, and was like to be, all on a sudden there stood before him a little, rough-looking, black dwarf.",surprise
"""Prithee, friend, why so sorrowful?"" said he to the merchant; ""what is it you take so deeply to heart?""",sadness
"But as he drew near home, his little boy was so glad to see him that he crept behind him, and laid fast hold of his legs, and looked up in his face and laughed.",joy
"At the sight of this he was overjoyed, and forgetting all about his son, went into trade again, and became a richer merchant than before.",joy
"Meantime little Heinel grew up, and as the end of the twelve years drew near the merchant began to call to mind his bond, and became very sad and thoughtful; so that care and sorrow were written upon his face.",sadness
"The old man grinned, and showed his teeth, as if he should have been very glad to get into the circle if he could.",joy
"Then he took leave of his father, and set himself in the boat, but before it got far off a wave struck it, and it fell with one side low in the water, so the merchant thought that poor Heinel was lost, and went home very sorrowful, while the dwarf went his way, thinking that at any rate he had had his revenge.",sadness
"The young man sat safe within, till at length it ran ashore upon an unknown land.",joy
"Now the white snake was an enchanted princess; and she was very glad to see him, and said, ""Are you at last come to set me free?",joy
"And all came to pass as she had said; Heinel bore all, and spoke not a word; and the third night the princess came, and fell on his neck and kissed him.",joy
"Joy and gladness burst forth throughout the castle, the wedding was celebrated, and he was crowned king of the Golden Mountain.",joy
"They lived together very happily, and the queen had a son.",joy
"And thus eight years had passed over their heads, when the king thought of his father; and he began to long to see him once again.",sadness
"When he came to his father""s house, he said he was his son; but the merchant would not believe him, and said he had had but one son, his poor Heinel, who he knew was long since dead: and as he was only dressed like a poor shepherd, he would not even give him anything to eat.",sadness
"At this the son was vexed; and forgetting his word, turned his ring, and wished for his queen and son.",anger
"In an instant they stood before him; but the queen wept, and said he had broken his word, and bad luck would follow.",sadness
"He did all he could to soothe her, and she at last seemed to be appeased; but she was not so in truth, and was only thinking how she should punish him.",anger
"""Alas!"" said she to herself, ""was I not once set free?",sadness
"""False and fickle one!"" said he.",anger
"But the princes, peers, and great men mocked at him.",anger
"He had not even so much as a cow, and still less money to buy one, and yet he and his wife did so wish to have one.",sadness
"The little calf always remained standing like one which was eating, and the cow-herd said: ""It will soon run by itself, just look how it eats already!""",joy
"At night when he was going to drive the herd home again, he said to the calf: ""If you can stand there and eat your fill, you can also go on your four legs; I don""t care to drag you home again in my arms.""",anger
"It would not stop and come with us.""",anger
"The peasant, however, said: ""Don""t tell me that,"" and led the cow-herd before the mayor, who for his carelessness condemned him to give the peasant a cow for the calf which had run away.",anger
"And now the little peasant and his wife had the cow for which they had so long wished, and they were heartily glad, but they had no food for it, and could give it nothing to eat, so it soon had to be killed.",sadness
"They salted the flesh, and the peasant went into the town and wanted to sell the skin there, so that he might buy a new calf with the proceeds.",sadness
"On the way he passed by a mill, and there sat a raven with broken wings, and out of pity he took him and wrapped him in the skin.",sadness
"In the meantime came the parson; the miller""s wife received him well, and said: ""My husband is out, so we will have a feast.""",joy
"The peasant listened, and when he heard them talk about feasting he was vexed that he had been forced to make shift with a slice of bread and cheese.",anger
"Just as they were about to sit down and eat, there was a knocking outside.",surprise
"The woman said: ""Oh, heavens!",surprise
"It is my husband!"" she quickly hid the roast meat inside the tiled stove, the wine under the pillow, the salad on the bed, the cakes under it, and the parson in the closet on the porch.",surprise
"The miller saw the peasant lying on the straw, and asked, ""What is that fellow doing there?""",surprise
"""Ah,"" said the wife, ""the poor knave came in the storm and rain, and begged for shelter, so I gave him a bit of bread and cheese, and showed him where the straw was.""",sadness

"""I am contented with anything,"" replied the husband, ""so far as I am concerned, bread and cheese will do,"" and looked at the peasant and said: ""Come and eat some more with me.""",joy
"The peasant did not require to be invited twice, but got up and ate.",joy
"After this the miller saw the skin in which the raven was, lying on the ground, and asked: ""What have you there?""",surprise
"""Can he foretell anything to me?"" said the miller.",surprise
"""Why not?"" answered the peasant: ""but he only says four things, and the fifth he keeps to himself.""",surprise
"The miller was curious, and said: ""Let him foretell something for once.""",surprise
"The miller said: ""What did he say?""",surprise
"""Bless me!"" cried the miller, and went there and found the wine.",surprise
"""Now go on,"" said he.",surprise
"""Upon my word!"" cried the miller, and went thither, and found the roast meat.",surprise
"""That would be a fine thing!"" cried the miller, and went there and found the salad.",surprise
"""That would be a fine thing!"" cried the miller, and looked there, and found the cakes.",surprise
"The peasant, however, made off next morning by daybreak with the three hundred talers.",joy
"At home the small peasant gradually launched out; he built a beautiful house, and the peasants said: ""The small peasant has certainly been to the place where golden snow falls, and people carry the gold home in shovels.""",joy
"When the peasants heard that, they too wished to enjoy this great profit, and ran home, killed all their cows, and stripped off their skins in order to sell them in the town to the greatest advantage.",surprise

"When she came to the merchant in the town, he did not give her more than two talers for a skin, and when the others came, he did not give them so much, and said: ""What can I do with all these skins?""",anger
"Then the peasants were vexed that the small peasant should have thus outwitted them, wanted to take vengeance on him, and accused him of this treachery before the major.",anger
"The others were all obliged to retire to a distance, and when the peasant looked at the priest, he recognized the man who had been with the miller""s wife.",surprise
"The shepherd hearing that, came up to him, and asked: ""What are you about?",surprise
"What is it that you will not do?""",surprise
"The shepherd said: ""If nothing more than that is needful in order to be mayor, I would get into the barrel at once.""",surprise
"The shepherd was willing, and got in, and the peasant shut the top down on him; then he took the shepherd""s flock for himself, and drove it away.",joy
"They believed no otherwise than that it was the peasant who was saying this, and answered: ""That is what we intend, but first you shall look about you a little down below there,"" and they rolled the barrel down into the water.",joy
"After that the peasants went home, and as they were entering the village, the small peasant also came quietly in, driving a flock of sheep and looking quite contented.",joy
"Then the peasants were astonished, and said: ""Peasant, from whence do you come?",surprise
"Have you come out of the water?""",surprise
"""Yes, truly,"" replied the peasant, ""I sank deep, deep down, until at last I got to the bottom; I pushed the bottom out of the barrel, and crept out, and there were pretty meadows on which a number of lambs were feeding, and from thence I brought this flock away with me.""",joy
"Said the peasants: ""Are there any more there?""",surprise
"""Oh, yes,"" said he, ""more than I could want.""",joy
"Then the peasants made up their minds that they too would fetch some sheep for themselves, a flock apiece, but the mayor said: ""I come first.""",joy
"So they went to the water together, and just then there were some of the small fleecy clouds in the blue sky, which are called little lambs, and they were reflected in the water, whereupon the peasants cried: ""We already see the sheep down below!""",surprise

"So he jumped in; splash! went the water; it sounded as if he were calling them, and the whole crowd plunged in after him as one man.",joy
"Then the entire village was dead, and the small peasant, as sole heir, became a rich man.",joy
"A farmer had a faithful and diligent servant, who had worked hard for him three years, without having been paid any wages.",anger
"At last it came into the man""s head that he would not go on thus without pay any longer; so he went to his master, and said, ""I have worked hard for you a long time, I will trust to you to give me what I deserve to have for my trouble.""",anger
"The poor fellow thought it was a great deal of money to have, and said to himself, ""Why should I work hard, and live here on bad fare any longer?",joy
"I can now travel into the wide world, and make myself merry.""",joy
"With that he put his money into his purse, and set out, roaming over hill and valley.",joy

"I have saved up my three years"" earnings and have it all safe in my pocket.""",joy
"""I wish you would give them to me,"" said the other; ""I am very poor.""",sadness

"Then the countryman rejoiced at his good luck, and said, ""I like many things better than money: first, I will have a bow that will bring down everything I shoot at; secondly, a fiddle that will set everyone dancing that hears me play upon it; and thirdly, I should like that everyone should grant what I ask.""",joy
"The dwarf said he should have his three wishes; so he gave him the bow and fiddle, and went his way.",joy

"""Oh, what a pretty bird!"" said the miser; ""I would give a great deal of money to have such a one.""",joy

"""Thou hast shaved many a poor soul close enough,"" said the other; ""thou art only meeting thy reward"": so he played up another tune.",anger
"When the countryman saw so much money, he said, ""I will agree to your proposal.""",surprise

"Meanwhile the miser crept out of the bush half-naked and in a piteous plight, and began to ponder how he should take his revenge, and serve his late companion some trick.",anger
"At last he went to the judge, and complained that a rascal had robbed him of his money, and beaten him into the bargain; and that the fellow who did it carried a bow at his back and a fiddle hung round his neck.",anger
Then the judge sent out his officers to bring up the accused wherever they should find him; and he was soon caught and brought up to be tried.,surprise
"The miser began to tell his tale, and said he had been robbed of his money.",anger
"""No, you gave it me for playing a tune to you."" said the countryman; but the judge told him that was not likely, and cut the matter short by ordering him off to the gallows.",anger
"""Anything but thy life,"" replied the other.",anger
"The miser cried out, ""Oh, no! no! for heaven""s sake don""t listen to him! don""t listen to him!""",anger
"But the judge said, ""It is only this once, he will soon have done.""",anger
"The fact was, he could not refuse the request, on account of the dwarf""s third gift.",anger
"But the countryman seized his fiddle, and struck up a tune, and at the first note judge, clerks, and jailer were in motion; all began capering, and no one could hold the miser.",anger
"At the second note the hangman let his prisoner go, and danced also, and by the time he had played the first bar of the tune, all were dancing together--judge, court, and miser, and all the people who had followed to look on.",anger
"Then he called to the miser, and said, ""Tell us now, you vagabond, where you got that gold, or I shall play on for your amusement only,"" ""I stole it,"" said the miser in the presence of all the people; ""I acknowledge that I stole it, and that you earned it fairly.""",anger
"Then the countryman stopped his fiddle, and left the miser to take his place at the gallows.",anger
"For a long time all went well; they lived in great comfort, and prospered so far as to be able to add considerably to their stores.",joy
"And so it came to pass, that the bird, while out one day, met a fellow bird, to whom he boastfully expatiated on the excellence of his household arrangements.",joy

"Influenced by those remarks, the bird next morning refused to bring in the wood, telling the others that he had been their servant long enough, and had been a fool into the bargain, and that it was now time to make a change, and to try some other way of arranging the work.",anger
"Beg and pray as the mouse and the sausage might, it was of no use; the bird remained master of the situation, and the venture had to be made.",anger
"They therefore drew lots, and it fell to the sausage to bring in the wood, to the mouse to cook, and to the bird to fetch the water.",sadness
"The bird complained to the dog of this bare-faced robbery, but nothing he said was of any avail, for the dog answered that he found false credentials on the sausage, and that was the reason his life had been forfeited.",anger

"His son and his son""s wife were disgusted at this, so the old grandfather at last had to sit in the corner behind the stove, and they gave him his food in an earthenware bowl, and not even enough of it.",anger

"Once, too, his trembling hands could not hold the bowl, and it fell to the ground and broke.",sadness

"""How shall I be able to get there?"" asked the man.",sadness
"""I have two hours to spare,"" said the giant, ""and I will carry you into the neighbourhood of the castle; I must then return to look after the child who is in our care.""",surprise

"When he saw that it was impossible to reach her, he was greatly grieved, and said to himself, ""I will remain here and wait for her,"" so he built himself a little hut, and there he sat and watched for a whole year, and every day he saw the king""s daughter driving round her castle, but still was unable to get nearer to her.",sadness
"They stopped when they heard the call, but looking round and seeing nobody, they went on again with their fighting, which now became more furious.",anger
"""God be with you,"" he cried again, and again they paused and looked about, but seeing no one went back to their fighting.",anger
"A third time he called out, ""God be with you,"" and then thinking he should like to know the cause of dispute between the three men, he went out and asked them why they were fighting so angrily with one another.",surprise
"They had been unable to decide whether they would keep together and have the things in common, or whether they would separate.",anger
"On hearing this, the man said, ""I will give you something in exchange for those three things; not money, for that I have not got, but something that is of far more value.",surprise
"Then he fell upon them with the stick and beat them one after another, crying, ""There, you idle vagabonds, you have got what you deserve; are you satisfied now!""",joy
"""That is my own ring,"" she exclaimed, ""and if that is so the man must also be here who is coming to set me free.""",surprise
"She sought for him about the castle, but could find him nowhere.",sadness

"Then he dismounted and took her in his arms; and she kissed him, and said, ""Now you have indeed set me free, and tomorrow we will celebrate our marriage.""",joy
But the girl did not care for the man as a girl ought to care for her betrothed husband.,sadness
"She did not feel that she could trust him, and she could not look at him nor think of him without an inward shudder.",anger
"""Ah, you poor child,"" answered the old woman, ""what a place for you to come to!",sadness
"If I did not take pity on you and save you, you would be lost.""",sadness
"I have long been waiting for an opportunity to escape.""",sadness
"They gave her wine to drink, three glasses full, one of white wine, one of red, and one of yellow, and with that her heart gave way and she died.",sadness
"As a merry young huntsman was once going briskly along through a wood, there came up a little old woman, and said to him, ""Good day, good day; you seem merry enough, but I am hungry and thirsty; do pray give me something to eat.""",sadness
"The huntsman took pity on her, and put his hand in his pocket and gave her what he had.",sadness
"Then he wanted to go his way; but she took hold of him, and said, ""Listen, my friend, to what I am going to tell you; I will reward you for your kindness; go your way, and after a little time you will come to a tree where you will see nine birds sitting on a cloak.",joy
"Shoot into the midst of them, and one will fall down dead: the cloak will fall too; take it, it is a wishing-cloak, and when you wear it you will find yourself at any place where you may wish to be.",joy
"Cut open the dead bird, take out its heart and keep it, and you will find a piece of gold under your pillow every morning when you rise.",joy
"It is the bird""s heart that will bring you this good luck.""",joy
"The huntsman thanked her, and thought to himself, ""If all this does happen, it will be a fine thing for me.""",joy
"When he had gone a hundred steps or so, he heard a screaming and chirping in the branches over him, and looked up and saw a flock of birds pulling a cloak with their bills and feet; screaming, fighting, and tugging at each other as if each wished to have it himself.",anger
"""Well,"" said the huntsman, ""this is wonderful; this happens just as the old woman said""; then he shot into the midst of them so that their feathers flew all about.",joy
"The next morning when he awoke he lifted up his pillow, and there lay the piece of gold glittering underneath; the same happened next day, and indeed every day when he arose.",joy
"He heaped up a great deal of gold, and at last thought to himself, ""Of what use is this gold to me whilst I am at home?",sadness
"I will go out into the world and look about me.""",joy
"Then he took leave of his friends, and hung his bag and bow about his neck, and went his way.",joy
"Now the old woman was a witch, and said to the young lady, ""There is a young man coming out of the wood who carries a wonderful prize; we must get it away from him, my dear child, for it is more fit for us than for him.",anger
"Meantime the huntsman came nearer and looked at the lady, and said to himself, ""I have been travelling so long that I should like to go into this castle and rest myself, for I have money enough to pay for anything I want""; but the real reason was, that he wanted to see more of the beautiful lady.",surprise
"Then he went into the house, and was welcomed kindly; and it was not long before he was so much in love that he thought of nothing else but looking at the lady""s eyes, and doing everything that she wished.",joy
"Then the old woman said, ""Now is the time for getting the bird""s heart.""",anger
"So the lady stole it away, and he never found any more gold under his pillow, for it lay now under the young lady""s, and the old woman took it away every morning; but he was so much in love that he never missed his prize.",joy
"""Well,"" said the old witch, ""we have got the bird""s heart, but not the wishing-cloak yet, and that we must also get.""",anger
"""Let us leave him that,"" said the young lady; ""he has already lost his wealth.""",sadness
"Then the witch was very angry, and said, ""Such a cloak is a very rare and wonderful thing, and I must and will have it.""",anger
"So she did as the old woman told her, and set herself at the window, and looked about the country and seemed very sorrowful; then the huntsman said, ""What makes you so sad?""",surprise
"""Alas! dear sir,"" said she, ""yonder lies the granite rock where all the costly diamonds grow, and I want so much to go there, that whenever I think of it I cannot help being sorrowful, for who can reach it? only the birds and the flies--man cannot.""",sadness
"""If that""s all your grief,"" said the huntsman, ""I""ll take there with all my heart""; so he drew her under his cloak, and the moment he wished to be on the granite mountain they were both there.",joy
The diamonds glittered so on all sides that they were delighted with the sight and picked up the finest.,joy
"But the old witch made a deep sleep come upon him, and he said to the young lady, ""Let us sit down and rest ourselves a little, I am so tired that I cannot stand any longer.""",sadness
"So they sat down, and he laid his head in her lap and fell asleep; and whilst he was sleeping on she took the cloak from his shoulders, hung it on her own, picked up the diamonds, and wished herself home again.",joy
"When he awoke and found that his lady had tricked him, and left him alone on the wild rock, he said, ""Alas! what roguery there is in the world!"" and there he sat in great grief and fear, not knowing what to do.",sadness
"When the giants came up to him, the first pushed him with his foot, and said, ""What worm is this that lies here curled up?""",anger
"""Tread upon him and kill him,"" said the second.",anger
"""It""s not worth the trouble,"" said the third; ""let him live, he""ll go climbing higher up the mountain, and some cloud will come rolling and carry him away.""",anger
"Then he looked around him, and said, ""I wish I had something to eat, if not I shall be worse off than before; for here I see neither apples nor pears, nor any kind of fruits, nothing but vegetables.""",sadness
"At last he thought to himself, ""I can eat salad, it will refresh and strengthen me.""",joy
"So he picked out a fine head and ate of it; but scarcely had he swallowed two bites when he felt himself quite changed, and saw with horror that he was turned into an ass.",surprise
"However, he still felt very hungry, and the salad tasted very nice; so he ate on till he came to another kind of salad, and scarcely had he tasted it when he felt another change come over him, and soon saw that he was lucky enough to have found his old shape again.",joy
"Then he laid himself down and slept off a little of his weariness; and when he awoke the next morning he broke off a head both of the good and the bad salad, and thought to himself, ""This will help me to my fortune again, and enable me to pay off some folks for their treachery.""",joy
So he went away to try and find the castle of his friends; and after wandering about a few days he luckily found it.,joy
"Then he stained his face all over brown, so that even his mother would not have known him, and went into the castle and asked for a lodging; ""I am so tired,"" said he, ""that I can go no farther.""",sadness
"""Countryman,"" said the witch, ""who are you? and what is your business?""",anger
"I have been lucky enough to find it, and have brought it with me; but the heat of the sun scorches so that it begins to wither, and I don""t know that I can carry it farther.""",sadness
"When the witch and the young lady heard of his beautiful salad, they longed to taste it, and said, ""Dear countryman, let us just taste it.""",surprise
"The messenger sat all this time with the beautiful young lady, and as nobody came with the salad and she longed to taste it, she said, ""I don""t know where the salad can be.""",sadness
"Then he thought something must have happened, and said, ""I will go into the kitchen and see.""",surprise
"And as he went he saw two asses in the court running about, and the salad lying on the ground.",joy
"""All right!"" said he; ""those two have had their share.""",joy
"Then he took up the rest of the leaves, laid them on the dish and brought them to the young lady, saying, ""I bring you the dish myself that you may not wait any longer.""",joy
Then the huntsman washed his face and went into the court that they might know him.,joy
"""Now you shall be paid for your roguery,"" said he; and tied them all three to a rope and took them along with him till he came to a mill and knocked at the window.",anger
"""I have three tiresome beasts here,"" said the other; ""if you will take them, give them food and room, and treat them as I tell you, I will pay you whatever you ask.""",anger
"""With all my heart,"" said the miller; ""but how shall I treat them?""",surprise
"Then the huntsman said, ""Give the old one stripes three times a day and hay once; give the next (who was the servant-maid) stripes once a day and hay three times; and give the youngest (who was the beautiful lady) hay three times a day and no stripes"": for he could not find it in his heart to have her beaten.",anger
"After this he went back to the castle, where he found everything he wanted.",joy
"Some days after, the miller came to him and told him that the old ass was dead; ""The other two,"" said he, ""are alive and eat, but are so sorrowful that they cannot last long.""",sadness
"Then the huntsman pitied them, and told the miller to drive them back to him, and when they came, he gave them some of the good salad to eat.",sadness
"And the beautiful young lady fell upon her knees before him, and said, ""O dearest huntsman! forgive me all the ill I have done you; my mother forced me to it, it was against my will, for I always loved you very much.",sadness
"But he said, ""Keep it, it will be just the same thing, for I mean to make you my wife.""",joy
"So they were married, and lived together very happily till they died.",joy
"Although the little girl was very pretty, she was so weak and small that they thought she could not live; but they said she should at once be christened.",sadness
"""Surely,"" said he, ""the whole seven must have forgotten themselves over some game of play""; and when he had waited still longer and they yet did not come, he flew into a rage and wished them all turned into ravens.",anger
"Sorry as he was to see his wish so fulfilled, he did not know how what was done could be undone, and comforted himself as well as he could for the loss of his seven sons with his dear little daughter, who soon became stronger and every day more beautiful.",sadness
For a long time she did not know that she had ever had any brothers; for her father and mother took care not to speak of them before her: but one day by chance she heard the people about her speak of them.,surprise
"Then she was much grieved, and went to her father and mother, and asked if she had any brothers, and what had become of them.",sadness
"So they dared no longer hide the truth from her, but said it was the will of Heaven, and that her birth was only the innocent cause of it; but the little girl mourned sadly about it every day, and thought herself bound to do all she could to bring her brothers back; and she had neither rest nor ease, till at length one day she stole away, and set out into the wide world to find her brothers, wherever they might be, and free them, whatever it might cost her.",sadness
"Then she felt for the little piece of wood; but when she unwrapped the cloth it was not there, and she saw she had lost the gift of the good stars.",sadness
"She wanted to save her brothers, and had no key of the castle of the glass-mountain; so this faithful little sister took a knife out of her pocket and cut off her little finger, that was just the size of the piece of wood she had lost, and put it in the door and opened it.",sadness
"Then the dwarf said, ""My masters are not at home; but if you will wait till they come, pray step in.""",sadness
"Now the little dwarf was getting their dinner ready, and he brought their food upon seven little plates, and their drink in seven little glasses, and set them upon the table, and out of each little plate their sister ate a small piece, and out of each little glass she drank a small drop; but she let the ring that she had brought with her fall into the last glass.",sadness
"When they came in, they wanted to eat and drink, and looked for their little plates and glasses.",anger
"""Who has eaten from my little plate?",anger
"And who has been drinking out of my little glass?""",anger
"""Caw!",anger
"Caw! well I ween Mortal lips have this way been.""",anger
"When the seventh came to the bottom of his glass, and found there the ring, he looked at it, and knew that it was his father""s and mother""s, and said, ""O that our little sister would but come! then we should be free.""",sadness
"When the little girl heard this (for she stood behind the door all the time and listened), she ran forward, and in an instant all the ravens took their right form again; and all hugged and kissed each other, and went merrily home.",joy
"""That, too, must be an art of which I understand nothing!""",sadness
"Look how your brother works, but you do not even earn your salt.""",anger
"""Well, father,"" he replied, ""I am quite willing to learn something-- indeed, if it could but be managed, I should like to learn how to shudder.",joy
"I don""t understand that at all yet.""",sadness
"The elder brother smiled when he heard that, and thought to himself: ""Goodness, what a blockhead that brother of mine is!",anger
He will never be good for anything as long as he lives!,anger
"The father sighed, and answered him: ""You shall soon learn what it is to shudder, but you will not earn your bread by that.""",anger
"Soon after this the sexton came to the house on a visit, and the father bewailed his trouble, and told him how his younger son was so backward in every respect that he knew nothing and learnt nothing.",sadness
"""Just think,"" said he, ""when I asked him how he was going to earn his bread, he actually wanted to learn to shudder.""",anger
"""If that be all,"" replied the sexton, ""he can learn that with me.",surprise
"The father was glad to do it, for he thought: ""It will train the boy a little.""",joy
"""You shall soon learn what shuddering is,"" thought he, and secretly went there before him; and when the boy was at the top of the tower and turned round, and was just going to take hold of the bell rope, he saw a white figure standing on the stairs opposite the sounding hole.",anger
"""Who is there?"" cried he, but the figure made no reply, and did not move or stir.",surprise
"""Give an answer,"" cried the boy, ""or take yourself off, you have no business here at night.""",anger
"The boy cried a second time: ""What do you want here?--speak if you are an honest fellow, or I will throw you down the steps!""",anger
"The sexton thought: ""He can""t mean to be as bad as his words,"" uttered no sound and stood as if he were made of stone.",surprise
"Then the boy called to him for the third time, and as that was also to no purpose, he ran against him and pushed the ghost down the stairs, so that it fell down the ten steps and remained lying there in a corner.",anger
"""No, I don""t know,"" replied the boy, ""but someone was standing by the sounding hole on the other side of the steps, and as he would neither gave an answer nor go away, I took him for a scoundrel, and threw him downstairs.",surprise
Just go there and you will see if it was he.,anger
"I should be sorry if it were.""",sadness
"She carried him down, and then with loud screams she hastened to the boy""s father, ""Your boy,"" cried she, ""has been the cause of a great misfortune!",anger
He has thrown my husband down the steps so that he broke his leg.,anger
"Take the good-for-nothing fellow out of our house.""",anger
"""What wicked tricks are these?"" said he.",anger
"""The devil must have put them into your head.""",anger
I am quite innocent.,anger
He was standing there by night like one intent on doing evil.,anger
"I did not know who it was, and I entreated him three times either to speak or to go away.""",anger
"""Ah,"" said the father, ""I have nothing but unhappiness with you.",anger
Go out of my sight.,anger
"I will see you no more.""",anger
"""Yes, father, right willingly, wait only until it is day.",sadness
"""Learn what you will,"" spoke the father, ""it is all the same to me.",anger

"""Yes, father, it shall be as you will.",sadness
"When the day dawned, therefore, the boy put his fifty talers into his pocket, and went forth on the great highway, and continually said to himself: ""If I could but shudder!",sadness
"If I could but shudder!""",sadness
"""If that is all that is wanted,"" answered the youth, ""it is easily done; but if I learn how to shudder as fast as that, you shall have my fifty talers.",surprise
"And as he was cold, he lighted himself a fire, but at midnight the wind blew so sharply that in spite of his fire, he could not get warm.",sadness
"And as the wind knocked the hanged men against each other, and they moved backwards and forwards, he thought to himself: ""If you shiver below by the fire, how those up above must freeze and suffer!""",sadness
"And as he felt pity for them, he raised the ladder, and climbed up, unbound one of them after the other, and brought down all seven.",sadness
"But they sat there and did not stir, and the fire caught their clothes.",surprise

"At this he grew angry, and said: ""If you will not take care, I cannot help you, I will not be burnt with you,"" and he hung them up again each in his turn.",anger

"""No,"" answered he, ""how should I know?",anger
"Those fellows up there did not open their mouths, and were so stupid that they let the few old rags which they had on their bodies get burnt.""",anger

"""Enough of your foolish chatter,"" said the waggoner.",anger
"Then at the entrance of the parlour the youth again said quite loudly: ""If I could but shudder!",sadness
"If I could but shudder!""",sadness
"The host who heard this, laughed and said: ""If that is your desire, there ought to be a good opportunity for you here.""",surprise
"But the youth said: ""However difficult it may be, I will learn it.",sadness
"He let the host have no rest, until the latter told him, that not far from thence stood a haunted castle where anyone could very easily learn what shuddering was, if he would but watch in it for three nights.",anger
"Then the youth went next morning to the king, and said: ""If it be allowed, I will willingly watch three nights in the haunted castle.""",joy
"The king looked at him, and as the youth pleased him, he said: ""You may ask for three things to take into the castle with you, but they must be things without life.""",joy
"""Ah, if I could but shudder!"" said he, ""but I shall not learn it here either.""",sadness
"Towards midnight he was about to poke his fire, and as he was blowing it, something cried suddenly from one corner: ""Au, miau! how cold we are!""",anger
"""You fools!"" cried he, ""what are you crying about?",anger
"If you are cold, come and take a seat by the fire and warm yourselves.""",anger
"And when he had said that, two great black cats came with one tremendous leap and sat down on each side of him, and looked savagely at him with their fiery eyes.",anger
"""Oh,"" said he, ""what long nails you have!",surprise
"Thereupon he seized them by the throats, put them on the cutting-board and screwed their feet fast.",anger
"""I have looked at your fingers,"" said he, ""and my fancy for card-playing has gone,"" and he struck them dead and threw them out into the water.",anger
"But when he had made away with these two, and was about to sit down again by his fire, out from every hole and corner came black cats and black dogs with red-hot chains, and more and more of them came until he could no longer move, and they yelled horribly, and got on his fire, pulled it to pieces, and tried to put it out.",anger
"He watched them for a while quietly, but at last when they were going too far, he seized his cutting-knife, and cried: ""Away with you, vermin,"" and began to cut them down.",anger
"Some of them ran away, the others he killed, and threw out into the fish-pond.",anger
Then he looked round and saw a great bed in the corner.,joy
"""That is the very thing for me,"" said he, and got into it.",joy
"""That""s right,"" said he, ""but go faster.""",surprise
"Then the bed rolled on as if six horses were harnessed to it, up and down, over thresholds and stairs, but suddenly hop, hop, it turned over upside down, and lay on him like a mountain.",surprise
"Then said he: ""After all it is a pity,--for so handsome a man.""",sadness
"The youth heard it, got up, and said: ""It has not come to that yet.""",joy
"Then the king was astonished, but very glad, and asked how he had fared.",surprise
"""Very well indeed,"" answered he; ""one night is past, the two others will pass likewise.""",joy
"Then he went to the innkeeper, who opened his eyes very wide, and said: ""I never expected to see you alive again!",surprise
"Have you learnt how to shudder yet?""",surprise
"""No,"" said he, ""it is all in vain.",sadness
"If someone would but tell me!""",sadness
"The second night he again went up into the old castle, sat down by the fire, and once more began his old song: ""If I could but shudder!""",sadness
"""Hullo!"" cried he, ""another half belongs to this.",joy
"This is not enough!""",anger
"""Wait,"" said he, ""I will just stoke up the fire a little for you.""",sadness
"""That is no part of our bargain,"" said the youth, ""the bench is mine.""",anger
"The man wanted to push him away; the youth, however, would not allow that, but thrust him off with all his strength, and seated himself again in his own place.",anger
"The youth also wanted to play and said: ""Listen you, can I join you?""",surprise
"""Money enough,"" replied he, ""but your balls are not quite round.""",surprise
"""There, now they will roll better!"" said he.",joy
"""Hurrah! now we""ll have fun!""",joy
"He played with them and lost some of his money, but when it struck twelve, everything vanished from his sight.",joy
"""How has it fared with you this time?"" asked he.",surprise
"""I have been playing at ninepins,"" he answered, ""and have lost a couple of farthings.""",sadness
"""Have you not shuddered then?""",surprise
"""What?"" said he, ""I have had a wonderful time!",joy
"If I did but know what it was to shudder!""",sadness
"The third night he sat down again on his bench and said quite sadly: ""If I could but shudder.""",sadness
"Then he said: ""Ha, ha, that is certainly my little cousin, who died only a few days ago,"" and he beckoned with his finger, and cried: ""Come, little cousin, come.""",joy
"He felt his face, but it was cold as ice.",anger
"""Wait,"" said he, ""I will warm you a little,"" and went to the fire and warmed his hand and laid it on the dead man""s face, but he remained cold.",surprise
"Then he took him out, and sat down by the fire and laid him on his breast and rubbed his arms that the blood might circulate again.",surprise
"As this also did no good, he thought to himself: ""When two people lie in bed together, they warm each other,"" and carried him to the bed, covered him over and lay down by him.",surprise
"Then said the youth, ""See, little cousin, have I not warmed you?""",joy
"The dead man, however, got up and cried: ""Now will I strangle you.""",anger
"""What!"" said he, ""is that the way you thank me?",anger
"You shall at once go into your coffin again,"" and he took him up, threw him into it, and shut the lid.",anger
"""I cannot manage to shudder,"" said he.",anger
"""I shall never learn it here as long as I live.""",sadness
"""You wretch,"" cried he, ""you shall soon learn what it is to shudder, for you shall die.""",anger
"""Not so fast,"" replied the youth.",anger
"""If I am to die, I shall have to have a say in it.""",anger
"""I will soon seize you,"" said the fiend.",anger
"""Softly, softly, do not talk so big.",anger
"I am as strong as you are, and perhaps even stronger.""",anger
"""We shall see,"" said the old man.",anger
"""If you are stronger, I will let you go--come, we will try.""",anger
"Then he led him by dark passages to a smith""s forge, took an axe, and with one blow struck an anvil into the ground.",anger
"""I can do better than that,"" said the youth, and went to the other anvil.",anger
"Then the youth seized the axe, split the anvil with one blow, and in it caught the old man""s beard.",anger
"""Now I have you,"" said the youth.",joy
"""Now it is your turn to die.""",anger
"Then he seized an iron bar and beat the old man till he moaned and entreated him to stop, when he would give him great riches.",anger
The youth drew out the axe and let him go.,surprise
"The old man led him back into the castle, and in a cellar showed him three chests full of gold.",joy
"In the meantime it struck twelve, and the spirit disappeared, so that the youth stood in darkness.",joy
"""I shall still be able to find my way out,"" said he, and felt about, found the way into the room, and slept there by his fire.",joy
"""No,"" he answered; ""what can it be?",sadness
"My dead cousin was here, and a bearded man came and showed me a great deal of money down below, but no one told me what it was to shudder.""",sadness
"""Then,"" said the king, ""you have saved the castle, and shall marry my daughter.""",joy
"""That is all very well,"" said he, ""but still I do not know what it is to shudder!""",sadness
"Then the gold was brought up and the wedding celebrated; but howsoever much the young king loved his wife, and however happy he was, he still said always: ""If I could but shudder--if I could but shudder.""",joy
And this at last angered her.,anger
"Her waiting-maid said: ""I will find a cure for him; he shall soon learn what it is to shudder.""",anger
"At night when the young king was sleeping, his wife was to draw the clothes off him and empty the bucket full of cold water with the gudgeons in it over him, so that the little fishes would sprawl about him.",anger
"Ah! now I know what it is to shudder!""",joy
"Then the straw began and said: ""Dear friends, from whence do you come here?""",surprise
"The coal replied: ""I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped by sheer force, my death would have been certain,--I should have been burnt to ashes.""",joy
"The bean said: ""I too have escaped with a whole skin, but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made into broth without any mercy, like my comrades.""",joy
"""The old woman has destroyed all my brethren in fire and smoke; she seized sixty of them at once, and took their lives.",sadness
"I luckily slipped through her fingers.""",joy
"The proposition pleased the two others, and they set out on their way together.",joy
"The bean, who had prudently stayed behind on the shore, could not but laugh at the event, was unable to stop, and laughed so heartily that she burst.",surprise
"It would have been all over with her, likewise, if, by good fortune, a tailor who was travelling in search of work, had not sat down to rest by the brook.",surprise
"As he had a compassionate heart he pulled out his needle and thread, and sewed her together.",joy
"The bean thanked him most prettily, but as the tailor used black thread, all beans since then have a black seam.",joy
"Then said the father: ""Hark you, my son, try as I will I can get nothing into your head.",anger
"You must go from hence, I will give you into the care of a celebrated master, who shall see what he can do with you.""",sadness
"""Lord have mercy on us!"" cried the father; ""is that all you have learnt?",anger
"I will send you into another town, to another master.""",anger
"Then the father fell into a rage and said: ""Oh, you lost man, you have spent the precious time and learnt nothing; are you not ashamed to appear before my eyes?",anger
"I will send you to a third master, but if you learn nothing this time also, I will no longer be your father.""",anger
"Then the father fell into the most furious anger, sprang up, called his people thither, and said: ""This man is no longer my son, I drive him forth, and command you to take him out into the forest, and kill him.""",anger
"They took him forth, but when they should have killed him, they could not do it for pity, and let him go, and they cut the eyes and tongue out of a deer that they might carry them to the old man as a token.",sadness
"The youth wandered on, and after some time came to a fortress where he begged for a night""s lodging.",sadness
"The whole district was in sorrow and dismay because of them, and yet no one could do anything to stop this.",sadness
"When he went inside, the dogs did not bark at him, but wagged their tails quite amicably around him, ate what he set before them, and did not hurt one hair of his head.",joy
"Next morning, to the astonishment of everyone, he came out again safe and unharmed, and said to the lord of the castle: ""The dogs have revealed to me, in their own language, why they dwell there, and bring evil on the land.",surprise
"Then all who heard this rejoiced, and the lord of the castle said he would adopt him as a son if he accomplished it successfully.",joy
"He went down again, and as he knew what he had to do, he did it thoroughly, and brought a chest full of gold out with him.",joy
"The howling of the wild dogs was henceforth heard no more; they had disappeared, and the country was freed from the trouble.",joy
"He listened to them, and when he became aware of what they were saying, he grew very thoughtful and sad.",sadness
"At last he arrived in Rome, where the Pope had just died, and there was great doubt among the cardinals as to whom they should appoint as his successor.",sadness
"And just as that was decided on, the young count entered into the church, and suddenly two snow-white doves flew on his shoulders and remained sitting there.",surprise
"The ecclesiastics recognized therein the token from above, and asked him on the spot if he would be pope.",surprise
"Then was he anointed and consecrated, and thus was fulfilled what he had heard from the frogs on his way, which had so affected him, that he was to be his Holiness the Pope.",joy
"Then he had to sing a mass, and did not know one word of it, but the two doves sat continually on his shoulders, and said it all in his ear.",joy
"""What makes you pant so, my friend?"" said the ass.",surprise
"""Alas!"" said the dog, ""my master was going to knock me on the head, because I am old and weak, and can no longer make myself useful to him in hunting; so I ran away; but what can I do to earn my livelihood?""",sadness
"""Hark ye!"" said the ass, ""I am going to the great city to turn musician: suppose you go with me, and try what you can do in the same way?""",joy
"The dog said he was willing, and they jogged on together.",joy
They had not gone far before they saw a cat sitting in the middle of the road and making a most rueful face.,sadness
"""Pray, my good lady,"" said the ass, ""what""s the matter with you?",surprise
"You look quite out of spirits!""",surprise
"Because I am beginning to grow old, and had rather lie at my ease by the fire than run about the house after the mice, my mistress laid hold of me, and was going to drown me; and though I have been lucky enough to get away from her, I do not know what I am to live upon.""",sadness
"""Oh,"" said the ass, ""by all means go with us to the great city; you are a good night singer, and may make your fortune as a musician.""",joy
"The cat was pleased with the thought, and joined the party.",joy
"Soon afterwards, as they were passing by a farmyard, they saw a cock perched upon a gate, and screaming out with all his might and main.",surprise
"""Bravo!"" said the ass; ""upon my word, you make a famous noise; pray what is all this about?""",joy
"""Heaven forbid!"" said the ass, ""come with us Master Chanticleer; it will be better, at any rate, than staying here to have your head cut off!",surprise
"If we care to sing in tune, we may get up some kind of a concert; so come along with us.""",joy
"""With all my heart,"" said the cock: so they all four went on jollily together.",joy
"In doing this, he saw afar off something bright and shining and calling to his companions said, ""There must be a house no great way off, for I see a light.""",surprise
"""If that be the case,"" said the ass, ""we had better change our quarters, for our lodging is not the best in the world!""",surprise
"""Besides,"" added the dog, ""I should not be the worse for a bone or two, or a bit of meat.""",joy
"""Why, I see a table spread with all kinds of good things, and robbers sitting round it making merry.""",surprise
"""That would be a noble lodging for us,"" said the cock.",joy
"""Yes,"" said the ass, ""if we could only get in""; so they consulted together how they should contrive to get the robbers out; and at last they hit upon a plan.",joy
"The ass brayed, the dog barked, the cat mewed, and the cock screamed; and then they all broke through the window at once, and came tumbling into the room, amongst the broken glass, with a most hideous clatter!",surprise
"The coast once clear, our travellers soon sat down and dispatched what the robbers had left, with as much eagerness as if they had not expected to eat again for a month.",joy
"As soon as they had satisfied themselves, they put out the lights, and each once more sought out a resting-place to his own liking.",joy
"But about midnight, when the robbers saw from afar that the lights were out and that all seemed quiet, they began to think that they had been in too great a hurry to run away; and one of them, who was bolder than the rest, went to see what was going on.",anger
"But the cat, not understanding this joke, sprang at his face, and spat, and scratched at him.",anger
"After this the robbers never dared to go back to the house; but the musicians were so pleased with their quarters that they took up their abode there; and there they are, I dare say, at this very day.",joy
"When the seed came up, there was one plant bigger than all the rest; and it kept getting larger and larger, and seemed as if it would never cease growing; so that it might have been called the prince of turnips for there never was such a one seen before, and never will again.",surprise
"At last it was so big that it filled a cart, and two oxen could hardly draw it; and the gardener knew not what in the world to do with it, nor whether it would be a blessing or a curse to him.",surprise
"One day he said to himself, ""What shall I do with it? if I sell it, it will bring no more than another; and for eating, the little turnips are better than this; the best thing perhaps is to carry it and give it to the king as a mark of respect.""",anger
"""What a wonderful thing!"" said the king; ""I have seen many strange things, but such a monster as this I never saw.",joy
Where did you get the seed? or is it only your good luck?,surprise
"If so, you are a true child of fortune.""",surprise
"""Ah, no!"" answered the gardener, ""I am no child of fortune; I am a poor soldier, who never could get enough to live upon; so I laid aside my red coat, and set to work, tilling the ground.",sadness
"I have a brother, who is rich, and your majesty knows him well, and all the world knows him; but because I am poor, everybody forgets me.""",sadness
"The king then took pity on him, and said, ""You shall be poor no longer.",sadness
"I will give you so much that you shall be even richer than your brother.""",joy
"Then he gave him gold and lands and flocks, and made him so rich that his brother""s fortune could not at all be compared with his.",joy
"When the brother heard of all this, and how a turnip had made the gardener so rich, he envied him sorely, and bethought himself how he could contrive to get the same good fortune for himself.",anger
"However, he determined to manage more cleverly than his brother, and got together a rich present of gold and fine horses for the king; and thought he must have a much larger gift in return; for if his brother had received so much for only a turnip, what must his present be wroth?",anger
"The king took the gift very graciously, and said he knew not what to give in return more valuable and wonderful than the great turnip; so the soldier was forced to put it into a cart, and drag it home with him.",surprise
"When he reached home, he knew not upon whom to vent his rage and spite; and at length wicked thoughts came into his head, and he resolved to kill his brother.",anger
"So he hired some villains to murder him; and having shown them where to lie in ambush, he went to his brother, and said, ""Dear brother, I have found a hidden treasure; let us go and dig it up, and share it between us.""",anger
"The other had no suspicions of his roguery: so they went out together, and as they were travelling along, the murderers rushed out upon him, bound him, and were going to hang him on a tree.",surprise
"When the horseman came up, he proved to be a student, a merry fellow, who was journeying along on his nag, and singing as he went.",joy
"As soon as the man in the sack saw him passing under the tree, he cried out, ""Good morning! good morning to thee, my friend!""",surprise
"Then the man in the tree answered, ""Lift up thine eyes, for behold here I sit in the sack of wisdom; here have I, in a short time, learned great and wondrous things.",joy
"A little longer, and I shall know all that man can know, and shall come forth wiser than the wisest of mankind.",joy
"Here I discern the signs and motions of the heavens and the stars; the laws that control the winds; the number of the sands on the seashore; the healing of the sick; the virtues of all simples, of birds, and of precious stones.",joy
"Wert thou but once here, my friend, though wouldst feel and own the power of knowledge.",joy
"The student listened to all this and wondered much; at last he said, ""Blessed be the day and hour when I found you; cannot you contrive to let me into the sack for a little while?""",joy
"Then the other answered, as if very unwillingly, ""A little space I may allow thee to sit here, if thou wilt reward me well and entreat me kindly; but thou must tarry yet an hour below, till I have learnt some little matters that are yet unknown to me.""",joy
"So the student sat himself down and waited a while; but the time hung heavy upon him, and he begged earnestly that he might ascend forthwith, for his thirst for knowledge was great.",anger
"Then the other pretended to give way, and said, ""Thou must let the sack of wisdom descend, by untying yonder cord, and then thou shalt enter.""",anger
"So the student let him down, opened the sack, and set him free.",joy
"""Now then,"" cried he, ""let me ascend quickly.""",joy
"Then he pushed him in head first, tied up the sack, and soon swung up the searcher after wisdom dangling in the air.",surprise
"""How is it with thee, friend?"" said he, ""dost thou not feel that wisdom comes unto thee?",joy
"Rest there in peace, till thou art a wiser man than thou wert.""",anger
"So saying, he trotted off on the student""s nag, and left the poor fellow to gather wisdom till somebody should come and let him down.",anger
"He was well entertained, and in the evening was taken to the chamber next to the one where the princesses lay in their twelve beds.",joy
"""I hardly know where I am going, or what I had better do,"" said the soldier; ""but I think I should like very well to find out where it is that the princesses dance, and then in time I might be a king.""",sadness
"When the soldier heard all this good counsel, he determined to try his luck: so he went to the king, and said he was willing to undertake the task.",joy
"He was as well received as the others had been, and the king ordered fine royal robes to be given him; and when the evening came he was led to the outer chamber.",joy
"When the twelve princesses heard this they laughed heartily; and the eldest said, ""This fellow too might have done a wiser thing than lose his life in this way!""",joy
"Then they rose up and opened their drawers and boxes, and took out all their fine clothes, and dressed themselves at the glass, and skipped about as if they were eager to begin dancing.",joy
"""You simpleton,"" said the eldest, ""you are always afraid; have you forgotten how many kings"" sons have already watched in vain?",anger
"""You silly creature!"" said the eldest, ""it is nothing but a nail in the wall.""",anger
"As they were rowing over the lake, the prince who was in the boat with the youngest princess and the soldier said, ""I do not know why it is, but though I am rowing with all my might we do not get on so fast as usual, and I am quite tired: the boat seems very heavy today.""",surprise
"""It is only the heat of the weather,"" said the princess: ""I feel it very warm too.""",sadness
"In the morning the soldier said nothing about what had happened, but determined to see more of this strange adventure, and went again the second and third night; and every thing happened just as before; the princesses danced each time till their shoes were worn to pieces, and then returned home.",joy
"And when he was sitting beside her and very happy, news came that his father lay sick unto death, and desired to see him once again before his end.",sadness
"Then he said to his beloved: ""I must now go and leave you, I give you a ring as a remembrance of me.",sadness
"When I am king, I will return and fetch you.""",sadness
"The son was in such trouble that he did not think what he was doing, and said: ""Yes, dear father, your will shall be done,"" and thereupon the king shut his eyes, and died.",sadness
"When therefore the son had been proclaimed king, and the time of mourning was over, he was forced to keep the promise which he had given his father, and caused the king""s daughter to be asked in marriage, and she was promised to him.",sadness
"His first betrothed heard of this, and fretted so much about his faithfulness that she nearly died.",sadness
"Thereupon she took her leave of her father, and rode away with them, and rode to the court of her former betrothed, whom she loved so dearly.",sadness
"The king looked at her and did not know her, but as they were such handsome fellows, he said: ""Yes,"" and that he would willingly take them, and now they were the king""s twelve huntsmen.",joy
"It came to pass that one evening he said to the king: ""You think you have twelve huntsmen?""",anger
"The lion continued: ""You are mistaken, they are twelve girls.""",anger
"The king said: ""That cannot be true!",anger
"How will you prove that to me?""",anger
"Men have a firm step, and when they walk over peas none of them stir, but girls trip and skip, and drag their feet, and the peas roll about.""",anger
"The king was well pleased with the counsel, and caused the peas to be strewn.",joy
"Then they went away again, and the king said to the lion: ""You have lied to me, they walk just like men.""",surprise
"The lion said: ""They have been informed that they were going to be put to the test, and have assumed some strength.",anger
"The king liked the advice, and had the spinning-wheels placed in the ante-chamber.",joy
"Then the king again said to the lion: ""You have deceived me, they are men, for they have not looked at the spinning-wheels.""",surprise
"The king, however, would no longer believe the lion.",anger
"The twelve huntsmen always followed the king to the chase, and his liking for them continually increased.",joy
"When the true bride heard that, it hurt her so much that her heart was almost broken, and she fell fainting to the ground.",sadness
"Then he saw the ring which he had given to his first bride, and when he looked in her face he recognized her.",surprise
"Then his heart was so touched that he kissed her, and when she opened her eyes he said: ""You are mine, and I am yours, and no one in the world can alter that.""",joy
"Thereupon the wedding was celebrated, and the lion was again taken into favour, because, after all, he had told the truth.",joy
"One summer""s morning a little tailor was sitting on his table by the window; he was in good spirits, and sewed with all his might.",joy
"This rang pleasantly in the tailor""s ears; he stretched his delicate head out of the window, and called: ""Come up here, dear woman; here you will get rid of your goods.""",joy
"He inspected each one, lifted it up, put his nose to it, and at length said: ""The jam seems to me to be good, so weigh me out four ounces, dear woman, and if it is a quarter of a pound that is of no consequence.""",joy
"The woman who had hoped to find a good sale, gave him what he desired, but went away quite angry and grumbling.",anger
"""Now, this jam shall be blessed by God,"" cried the little tailor, ""and give me health and strength""; so he brought the bread out of the cupboard, cut himself a piece right across the loaf and spread the jam over it.",joy
"He laid the bread near him, sewed on, and in his joy, made bigger and bigger stitches.",joy
"In the meantime the smell of the sweet jam rose to where the flies were sitting in great numbers, and they were attracted and descended on it in hosts.",joy
"""Hi! who invited you?"" said the little tailor, and drove the unbidden guests away.",joy
"The little tailor at last lost all patience, and drew a piece of cloth from the hole under his work-table, and saying: ""Wait, and I will give it to you,"" struck it mercilessly on them.",anger
"""Are you a fellow of that sort?"" said he, and could not help admiring his own bravery.",joy
"""The whole town shall know of this!""",joy
"And the little tailor hastened to cut himself a girdle, stitched it, and embroidered on it in large letters: ""Seven at one stroke!""",joy
"""What, the town!"" he continued, ""the whole world shall hear of it!"" and his heart wagged with joy like a lamb""s tail.",joy
"The tailor put on the girdle, and resolved to go forth into the world, because he thought his workshop was too small for his valour.",joy
"Now he took to the road boldly, and as he was light and nimble, he felt no fatigue.",joy
"The road led him up a mountain, and when he had reached the highest point of it, there sat a powerful giant looking peacefully about him.",joy

"I am just on my way thither, and want to try my luck.",joy
"The giant looked contemptuously at the tailor, and said: ""You ragamuffin!",anger
"You miserable creature!""",anger
"""Oh, indeed?"" answered the little tailor, and unbuttoned his coat, and showed the giant the girdle, ""there may you read what kind of a man I am!""",surprise
"The giant read: ""Seven at one stroke,"" and thought that they had been men whom the tailor had killed, and began to feel a little respect for the tiny fellow.",surprise
"""Is that all?"" said the tailor, ""that is child""s play with us!"" and put his hand into his pocket, brought out the soft cheese, and pressed it until the liquid ran out of it.",joy
"""Faith,"" said he, ""that was a little better, wasn""t it?""",joy
"The giant did not know what to say, and could not believe it of the little man.",surprise
"""Now, little mite of a man, do that likewise,"" ""Well thrown,"" said the tailor, ""but after all the stone came down to earth again; I will throw you one which shall never come back at all,"" and he put his hand into his pocket, took out the bird, and threw it into the air.",joy
"The bird, delighted with its liberty, rose, flew away and did not come back.",joy
"The giant took the trunk on his shoulder, but the tailor seated himself on a branch, and the giant, who could not look round, had to carry away the whole tree, and the little tailor into the bargain: he behind, was quite merry and happy, and whistled the song: ""Three tailors rode forth from the gate,"" as if carrying the tree were child""s play.",joy

"Have you not strength enough to hold the weak twig?""",surprise
"When it was midnight, and the giant thought that the little tailor was lying in a sound sleep, he got up, took a great iron bar, cut through the bed with one blow, and thought he had finished off the grasshopper for good.",joy

"When the time came the mother harnessed the horse to the cart, and put Tom into his ear; and as he sat there the little man told the beast how to go, crying out, ""Go on!"" and ""Stop!"" as he wanted: and thus the horse went on just as well as if the woodman had driven it himself into the wood.",surprise
"""What an odd thing that is!"" said one: ""there is a cart going along, and I hear a carter talking to the horse, but yet I can see no one.""",surprise

"""Where""s that?"" said the wolf.",surprise
"The wolf did not want to be asked twice; so that very night he went to the house and crawled through the drain into the kitchen, and then into the pantry, and ate and drank there to his heart""s content.",joy

"""What""s that to me?"" said the little man; ""you have had your frolic, now I""ve a mind to be merry myself""; and he began, singing and shouting as loud as he could.",joy
"Tom heard all this, and cried out, ""Father, father!",joy
"And his father said, ""Heaven be praised! we have found our dear child again""; and he told his wife not to use the scythe for fear she should hurt him.",joy

"""Ah!"" said the father, ""what fears we have had for you!""",joy
"""Yes, father,"" answered he; ""I have travelled all over the world, I think, in one way or other, since we parted; and now I am very glad to come home and get fresh air again.""",joy
"""Why, where have you been?"" said his father.",surprise
"""I have been in a mouse-hole--and in a snail-shell--and down a cow""s throat-- and in the wolf""s belly; and yet here I am again, safe and sound.""",joy
"""Well,"" said they, ""you are come back, and we will not sell you again for all the riches in the world.""",joy
